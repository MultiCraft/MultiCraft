#    Filtered textures can blend RGB values with fully-transparent neighbors,
#    which PNG optimizers usually discard, sometimes resulting in a dark or

#    When using bilinear/trilinear/anisotropic filters, low-resolution textures
#    can be blurred, so automatically upscale them with nearest-neighbor
#    interpolation to preserve crisp pixels. This sets the minimum texture size
#    for the upscaled textures; higher values look sharper, but require more
#    memory.  Powers of 2 are recommended. Setting this higher than 1 may not
#    have a visible effect unless bilinear/trilinear/anisotropic filtering is

#    Visible spaces appear between nodes when shaders are disabled.
