Introduction
------------

Content and functionality can be added to Minetest using Lua scripting
in run-time loaded mods.

A mod is a self-contained bunch of scripts, textures and other related
things, which is loaded by and interfaces with Minetest.

Mods are contained and ran solely on the server side. Definitions and media
files are automatically transferred to the client.

If you see a deficiency in the API, feel free to attempt to add the
functionality in the engine and API, and to document it here.

Programming in Lua
------------------

If you have any difficulty in understanding this, please read
[Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/).

Startup
-------

Mods are loaded during server startup from the mod load paths by running
the `init.lua` scripts in a shared environment.

Paths
-----

* `RUN_IN_PLACE=1` (Windows release, local build)
    * `$path_user`: `<build directory>`
    * `$path_share`: `<build directory>`
* `RUN_IN_PLACE=0`: (Linux release)
    * `$path_share`:
        * Linux: `/usr/share/minetest`
        * Windows: `<install directory>/minetest-0.4.x`
    * `$path_user`:
        * Linux: `$HOME/.minetest`
        * Windows: `C:/users/<user>/AppData/minetest` (maybe)




Games
=====

Games are looked up from:

* `$path_share/games/<gameid>/`
* `$path_user/games/<gameid>/`

Where `<gameid>` is unique to each game.

The game directory can contain the following files:

* `game.conf`, with the following keys:
    * `name`: Required, a human readable title to address the game, e.g. `name = Minetest`.
    * `description`: Short description to be shown in the content tab
    * `allowed_mapgens = <comma-separated mapgens>`
      e.g. `allowed_mapgens = v5,v6,flat`
      Mapgens not in this list are removed from the list of mapgens for the
      game.
      If not specified, all mapgens are allowed.
    * `disallowed_mapgens = <comma-separated mapgens>`
      e.g. `disallowed_mapgens = v5,v6,flat`
      These mapgens are removed from the list of mapgens for the game.
      When both `allowed_mapgens` and `disallowed_mapgens` are
      specified, `allowed_mapgens` is applied before
      `disallowed_mapgens`.
    * `disallowed_mapgen_settings= <comma-separated mapgen settings>`
      e.g. `disallowed_mapgen_settings = mgv5_spflags`
      These settings are hidden for this game in the world creation
      dialog and game start menu.
    * `author`: The author of the game. It only appears when downloaded from
                ContentDB.
    * `release`: Ignore this: Should only ever be set by ContentDB, as it is
                 an internal ID used to track versions.
* `multicraft.conf`:
  Used to set default settings when running this game.
* `settingtypes.txt`:
  In the same format as the one in builtin.
  This settingtypes.txt will be parsed by the menu and the settings will be
  displayed in the "Games" category in the advanced settings tab.
* If the game contains a folder called `textures` the server will load it as a
  texturepack, overriding mod textures.
  Any server texturepack will override mod textures and the game texturepack.

Menu images
-----------

Games can provide custom main menu images. They are put inside a `menu`
directory inside the game directory.

The images are named `$identifier.png`, where `$identifier` is one of
`overlay`, `background`, `footer`, `header`.
If you want to specify multiple images for one identifier, add additional
images named like `$identifier.$n.png`, with an ascending number $n starting
with 1, and a random image will be chosen from the provided ones.




Mods
====

Mod load path
-------------

Paths are relative to the directories listed in the [Paths] section above.

* `games/<gameid>/mods/`
* `mods/`
* `worlds/<worldname>/worldmods/`

World-specific games
--------------------

It is possible to include a game in a world; in this case, no mods or
games are loaded or checked from anywhere else.

This is useful for e.g. adventure worlds and happens if the `<worldname>/game/`
directory exists.

Mods should then be placed in `<worldname>/game/mods/`.

Modpacks
--------

Mods can be put in a subdirectory, if the parent directory, which otherwise
should be a mod, contains a file named `modpack.conf`.
The file is a key-value store of modpack details.

* `name`: The modpack name. Allows Minetest to determine the modpack name even
          if the folder is wrongly named.
* `description`: Description of mod to be shown in the Mods tab of the main
                 menu.
* `author`: The author of the modpack. It only appears when downloaded from
            ContentDB.
* `release`: Ignore this: Should only ever be set by ContentDB, as it is an
             internal ID used to track versions.
* `title`: A human-readable title to address the modpack.

Note: to support 0.4.x, please also create an empty modpack.txt file.

Mod directory structure

    └── another

### modname

The location of this directory can be fetched by using
`minetest.get_modpath(modname)`.

### mod.conf

A `Settings` file that provides meta information about the mod.

* `name`: The mod name. Allows Minetest to determine the mod name even if the
          folder is wrongly named.
* `description`: Description of mod to be shown in the Mods tab of the main
                 menu.
* `depends`: A comma separated list of dependencies. These are mods that must be
             loaded before this mod.
* `optional_depends`: A comma separated list of optional dependencies.
                      Like a dependency, but no error if the mod doesn't exist.
* `author`: The author of the mod. It only appears when downloaded from
            ContentDB.
* `release`: Ignore this: Should only ever be set by ContentDB, as it is an
             internal ID used to track versions.
* `title`: A human-readable title to address the mod.

Note: to support 0.4.x, please also provide depends.txt.

### `screenshot.png`

A screenshot shown in the mod manager within the main menu. It should
have an aspect ratio of 3:2 and a minimum size of 300×200 pixels.

### `depends.txt`

**Deprecated:** you should use mod.conf instead.

This file is used if there are no dependencies in mod.conf.

List of mods that have to be loaded before loading this mod.

A single line contains a single modname.

Optional dependencies can be defined by appending a question mark
to a single modname. This means that if the specified mod
is missing, it does not prevent this mod from being loaded.

### `description.txt`

**Deprecated:** you should use mod.conf instead.

This file is used if there is no description in mod.conf.

A file containing a description to be shown in the Mods tab of the main menu.

### `settingtypes.txt`

The format is documented in `builtin/settingtypes.txt`.
It is parsed by the main menu settings dialogue to list mod-specific
settings in the "Mods" category.

### `init.lua`

The main Lua script. Running this script should register everything it
wants to register. Subsequent execution depends on minetest calling the
registered callbacks.

`minetest.settings` can be used to read custom or existing settings at load
time, if necessary. (See [`Settings`])

### `textures`, `sounds`, `media`, `models`, `locale`

Media files (textures, sounds, whatever) that will be transferred to the
client and will be available for use by the mod and translation files for
the clients (see [Translations]).

It is suggested to use the folders for the purpous they are thought for,
eg. put textures into `textures`, translation files into `locale`,
models for entities or meshnodes into `models` et cetera.

These folders and subfolders can contain subfolders.
Subfolders with names starting with `_` or `.` are ignored.
If a subfolder contains a media file with the same name as a media file
in one of its parents, the parent's file is used.

Although it is discouraged, a mod can overwrite a media file of any mod that it
depends on by supplying a file with an equal name.

Naming conventions
------------------

Registered names should generally be in this format:

    modname:<whatever>

`<whatever>` can have these characters:

    a-zA-Z0-9_

This is to prevent conflicting names from corrupting maps and is
enforced by the mod loader.

Registered names can be overridden by prefixing the name with `:`. This can
be used for overriding the registrations of some other mod.

The `:` prefix can also be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

### Example

In the mod `experimental`, there is the ideal item/node/entity name `tnt`.
So the name should be `experimental:tnt`.

Any mod can redefine `experimental:tnt` by using the name

    :experimental:tnt

when registering it. That mod is required to have `experimental` as a
dependency.




Aliases
=======

Aliases of itemnames can be added by using
`minetest.register_alias(alias, original_name)` or
`minetest.register_alias_force(alias, original_name)`.

This adds an alias `alias` for the item called `original_name`.
From now on, you can use `alias` to refer to the item `original_name`.

The only difference between `minetest.register_alias` and
`minetest.register_alias_force` is that if an item named `alias` already exists,
`minetest.register_alias` will do nothing while
`minetest.register_alias_force` will unregister it.

This can be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

This can also set quick access names for things, e.g. if
you have an item called `epiclylongmodname:stuff`, you could do

    minetest.register_alias("stuff", "epiclylongmodname:stuff")

and be able to use `/giveme stuff`.

Mapgen aliases
--------------

In a game, a certain number of these must be set to tell core mapgens which
of the game's nodes are to be used for core mapgen generation. For example:

    minetest.register_alias("mapgen_stone", "default:stone")

### Aliases for non-V6 mapgens

#### Essential aliases

* mapgen_stone
* mapgen_water_source
* mapgen_river_water_source

`mapgen_river_water_source` is required for mapgens with sloping rivers where
it is necessary to have a river liquid node with a short `liquid_range` and
`liquid_renewable = false` to avoid flooding.

#### Optional aliases

* mapgen_lava_source

Fallback lava node used if cave liquids are not defined in biome definitions.
Deprecated for non-V6 mapgens, define cave liquids in biome definitions instead.

* mapgen_cobble

Fallback node used if dungeon nodes are not defined in biome definitions.
Deprecated for non-V6 mapgens, define dungeon nodes in biome definitions instead.

### Aliases needed for Mapgen V6

* mapgen_stone
* mapgen_water_source
* mapgen_lava_source
* mapgen_dirt
* mapgen_dirt_with_grass
* mapgen_sand
* mapgen_gravel
* mapgen_desert_stone
* mapgen_desert_sand
* mapgen_dirt_with_snow
* mapgen_snowblock
* mapgen_snow
* mapgen_ice

* mapgen_tree
* mapgen_leaves
* mapgen_apple
* mapgen_jungletree
* mapgen_jungleleaves
* mapgen_junglegrass
* mapgen_pine_tree
* mapgen_pine_needles

* mapgen_cobble
* mapgen_stair_cobble
* mapgen_mossycobble
* mapgen_stair_desert_stone

### Setting the node used in Mapgen Singlenode

By default the world is filled with air nodes. To set a different node use, for
example:

    minetest.register_alias("mapgen_singlenode", "default:stone")




Textures
========

Mods should generally prefix their textures with `modname_`, e.g. given
the mod name `foomod`, a texture could be called:

    foomod_foothing.png

Textures are referred to by their complete name, or alternatively by
stripping out the file extension:

* e.g. `foomod_foothing.png`
* e.g. `foomod_foothing`


Texture modifiers
-----------------

There are various texture modifiers that can be used
to let the client generate textures on-the-fly.
The modifiers are applied directly in sRGB colorspace,
i.e. without gamma-correction.

### Texture overlaying

Textures can be overlaid by putting a `^` between them.

Example:

    default_dirt.png^default_grass_side.png

`default_grass_side.png` is overlaid over `default_dirt.png`.
The texture with the lower resolution will be automatically upscaled to
the higher resolution texture.

### Texture grouping

Textures can be grouped together by enclosing them in `(` and `)`.

Example: `cobble.png^(thing1.png^thing2.png)`

A texture for `thing1.png^thing2.png` is created and the resulting
texture is overlaid on top of `cobble.png`.

### Escaping

Modifiers that accept texture names (e.g. `[combine`) accept escaping to allow
passing complex texture names as arguments. Escaping is done with backslash and
is required for `^` and `:`.

Example: `cobble.png^[lowpart:50:color.png\^[mask\:trans.png`

The lower 50 percent of `color.png^[mask:trans.png` are overlaid
on top of `cobble.png`.

### Advanced texture modifiers

#### Crack

* `[crack:<n>:<p>`
* `[cracko:<n>:<p>`
* `[crack:<t>:<n>:<p>`
* `[cracko:<t>:<n>:<p>`

Parameters:

* `<t>`: tile count (in each direction)
* `<n>`: animation frame count
* `<p>`: current animation frame

Draw a step of the crack animation on the texture.
`crack` draws it normally, while `cracko` lays it over, keeping transparent
pixels intact.

Example:

    default_cobble.png^[crack:10:1

#### `[combine:<w>x<h>:<x1>,<y1>=<file1>:<x2>,<y2>=<file2>:...`

* `<w>`: width
* `<h>`: height
* `<x>`: x position
* `<y>`: y position
* `<file>`: texture to combine

Creates a texture of size `<w>` times `<h>` and blits the listed files to their
specified coordinates.

Example:

    [combine:16x32:0,0=default_cobble.png:0,16=default_wood.png

#### `[resize:<w>x<h>`

Resizes the texture to the given dimensions.

Example:

    default_sandstone.png^[resize:16x16

#### `[opacity:<r>`

Makes the base image transparent according to the given ratio.

`r` must be between 0 (transparent) and 255 (opaque).

Example:

    default_sandstone.png^[opacity:127

#### `[invert:<mode>`

Inverts the given channels of the base image.
Mode may contain the characters "r", "g", "b", "a".
Only the channels that are mentioned in the mode string will be inverted.

Example:

    default_apple.png^[invert:rgb

#### `[brighten`

Brightens the texture.

Example:

    tnt_tnt_side.png^[brighten

#### `[noalpha`

Makes the texture completely opaque.

Example:

    default_leaves.png^[noalpha

#### `[makealpha:<r>,<g>,<b>`

Convert one color to transparency.

Example:

    default_cobble.png^[makealpha:128,128,128

#### `[transform<t>`

* `<t>`: transformation(s) to apply

Rotates and/or flips the image.

`<t>` can be a number (between 0 and 7) or a transform name.
Rotations are counter-clockwise.

    0  I      identity
    1  R90    rotate by 90 degrees
    2  R180   rotate by 180 degrees
    3  R270   rotate by 270 degrees
    4  FX     flip X
    5  FXR90  flip X then rotate by 90 degrees
    6  FY     flip Y
    7  FYR90  flip Y then rotate by 90 degrees

Example:

    default_stone.png^[transformFXR90

#### `[inventorycube{<top>{<left>{<right>`

Escaping does not apply here and `^` is replaced by `&` in texture names
instead.

Create an inventory cube texture using the side textures.

Example:

    [inventorycube{grass.png{dirt.png&grass_side.png{dirt.png&grass_side.png

Creates an inventorycube with `grass.png`, `dirt.png^grass_side.png` and
`dirt.png^grass_side.png` textures

#### `[lowpart:<percent>:<file>`

Blit the lower `<percent>`% part of `<file>` on the texture.

Example:

    base.png^[lowpart:25:overlay.png

#### `[verticalframe:<t>:<n>`

* `<t>`: animation frame count
* `<n>`: current animation frame

Crops the texture to a frame of a vertical animation.

Example:

    default_torch_animated.png^[verticalframe:16:8

#### `[mask:<file>`

Apply a mask to the base image.

The mask is applied using binary AND.

#### `[sheet:<w>x<h>:<x>,<y>`

Retrieves a tile at position x,y from the base image
which it assumes to be a tilesheet with dimensions w,h.

#### `[colorize:<color>:<ratio>`

Colorize the textures with the given color.
`<color>` is specified as a `ColorString`.
`<ratio>` is an int ranging from 0 to 255 or the word "`alpha`".  If
it is an int, then it specifies how far to interpolate between the
colors where 0 is only the texture color and 255 is only `<color>`. If
omitted, the alpha of `<color>` will be used as the ratio.  If it is
the word "`alpha`", then each texture pixel will contain the RGB of
`<color>` and the alpha of `<color>` multiplied by the alpha of the
texture pixel.

#### `[multiply:<color>`

Multiplies texture colors with the given color.
`<color>` is specified as a `ColorString`.
Result is more like what you'd expect if you put a color on top of another
color, meaning white surfaces get a lot of your new color while black parts
don't change very much.

Hardware coloring
-----------------

The goal of hardware coloring is to simplify the creation of
colorful nodes. If your textures use the same pattern, and they only
differ in their color (like colored wool blocks), you can use hardware
coloring instead of creating and managing many texture files.
All of these methods use color multiplication (so a white-black texture
with red coloring will result in red-black color).

### Static coloring

This method is useful if you wish to create nodes/items with
the same texture, in different colors, each in a new node/item definition.

#### Global color

When you register an item or node, set its `color` field (which accepts a
`ColorSpec`) to the desired color.

An `ItemStack`'s static color can be overwritten by the `color` metadata
field. If you set that field to a `ColorString`, that color will be used.

#### Tile color

Each tile may have an individual static color, which overwrites every
other coloring method. To disable the coloring of a face,
set its color to white (because multiplying with white does nothing).
You can set the `color` property of the tiles in the node's definition
if the tile is in table format.

### Palettes

For nodes and items which can have many colors, a palette is more
suitable. A palette is a texture, which can contain up to 256 pixels.
Each pixel is one possible color for the node/item.
You can register one node/item, which can have up to 256 colors.

#### Palette indexing

When using palettes, you always provide a pixel index for the given
node or `ItemStack`. The palette is read from left to right and from
top to bottom. If the palette has less than 256 pixels, then it is
stretched to contain exactly 256 pixels (after arranging the pixels
to one line). The indexing starts from 0.

Examples:

* 16x16 palette, index = 0: the top left corner
* 16x16 palette, index = 4: the fifth pixel in the first row
* 16x16 palette, index = 16: the pixel below the top left corner
* 16x16 palette, index = 255: the bottom right corner
* 2 (width) x 4 (height) palette, index = 31: the top left corner.
  The palette has 8 pixels, so each pixel is stretched to 32 pixels,
  to ensure the total 256 pixels.
* 2x4 palette, index = 32: the top right corner
* 2x4 palette, index = 63: the top right corner
* 2x4 palette, index = 64: the pixel below the top left corner

#### Using palettes with items

When registering an item, set the item definition's `palette` field to
a texture. You can also use texture modifiers.

The `ItemStack`'s color depends on the `palette_index` field of the
stack's metadata. `palette_index` is an integer, which specifies the
index of the pixel to use.

#### Linking palettes with nodes

When registering a node, set the item definition's `palette` field to
a texture. You can also use texture modifiers.
The node's color depends on its `param2`, so you also must set an
appropriate `paramtype2`:

* `paramtype2 = "color"` for nodes which use their full `param2` for
  palette indexing. These nodes can have 256 different colors.
  The palette should contain 256 pixels.
* `paramtype2 = "colorwallmounted"` for nodes which use the first
  five bits (most significant) of `param2` for palette indexing.
  The remaining three bits are describing rotation, as in `wallmounted`
  paramtype2. Division by 8 yields the palette index (without stretching the
  palette). These nodes can have 32 different colors, and the palette
  should contain 32 pixels.
  Examples:
    * `param2 = 17` is 2 * 8 + 1, so the rotation is 1 and the third (= 2 + 1)
      pixel will be picked from the palette.
    * `param2 = 35` is 4 * 8 + 3, so the rotation is 3 and the fifth (= 4 + 1)
      pixel will be picked from the palette.
* `paramtype2 = "colorfacedir"` for nodes which use the first
  three bits of `param2` for palette indexing. The remaining
  five bits are describing rotation, as in `facedir` paramtype2.
  Division by 32 yields the palette index (without stretching the
  palette). These nodes can have 8 different colors, and the
  palette should contain 8 pixels.
  Examples:
    * `param2 = 17` is 0 * 32 + 17, so the rotation is 17 and the
      first (= 0 + 1) pixel will be picked from the palette.
    * `param2 = 35` is 1 * 32 + 3, so the rotation is 3 and the
      second (= 1 + 1) pixel will be picked from the palette.

To colorize a node on the map, set its `param2` value (according
to the node's paramtype2).

### Conversion between nodes in the inventory and on the map

Static coloring is the same for both cases, there is no need
for conversion.

If the `ItemStack`'s metadata contains the `color` field, it will be
lost on placement, because nodes on the map can only use palettes.

If the `ItemStack`'s metadata contains the `palette_index` field, it is
automatically transferred between node and item forms by the engine,
when a player digs or places a colored node.
You can disable this feature by setting the `drop` field of the node
to itself (without metadata).
To transfer the color to a special drop, you need a drop table.

Example:

    minetest.register_node("mod:stone", {
        description = "Stone",
        tiles = {"default_stone.png"},
        paramtype2 = "color",
        palette = "palette.png",
        drop = {
            items = {
                -- assume that mod:cobblestone also has the same palette
                {items = {"mod:cobblestone"}, inherit_color = true },
            }
        }
    })

### Colored items in craft recipes

Craft recipes only support item strings, but fortunately item strings
can also contain metadata. Example craft recipe registration:

    minetest.register_craft({
        output = minetest.itemstring_with_palette("wool:block", 3),
        type = "shapeless",
        recipe = {
            "wool:block",
            "dye:red",
        },
    })

To set the `color` field, you can use `minetest.itemstring_with_color`.

Metadata field filtering in the `recipe` field are not supported yet,
so the craft output is independent of the color of the ingredients.

Soft texture overlay
--------------------

Sometimes hardware coloring is not enough, because it affects the
whole tile. Soft texture overlays were added to Minetest to allow
the dynamic coloring of only specific parts of the node's texture.
For example a grass block may have colored grass, while keeping the
dirt brown.

These overlays are 'soft', because unlike texture modifiers, the layers
are not merged in the memory, but they are simply drawn on top of each
other. This allows different hardware coloring, but also means that
tiles with overlays are drawn slower. Using too much overlays might
cause FPS loss.

For inventory and wield images you can specify overlays which
hardware coloring does not modify. You have to set `inventory_overlay`
and `wield_overlay` fields to an image name.

To define a node overlay, simply set the `overlay_tiles` field of the node
definition. These tiles are defined in the same way as plain tiles:
they can have a texture name, color etc.
To skip one face, set that overlay tile to an empty string.

Example (colored grass block):

    minetest.register_node("default:dirt_with_grass", {
        description = "Dirt with Grass",
        -- Regular tiles, as usual
        -- The dirt tile disables palette coloring
        tiles = {{name = "default_grass.png"},
            {name = "default_dirt.png", color = "white"}},
        -- Overlay tiles: define them in the same style
        -- The top and bottom tile does not have overlay
        overlay_tiles = {"", "",
            {name = "default_grass_side.png"}},
        -- Global color, used in inventory
        color = "green",
        -- Palette in the world
        paramtype2 = "color",
        palette = "default_foilage.png",
    })




Sounds
======

Only Ogg Vorbis files are supported.

For positional playing of sounds, only single-channel (mono) files are
supported. Otherwise OpenAL will play them non-positionally.

Mods should generally prefix their sounds with `modname_`, e.g. given
the mod name "`foomod`", a sound could be called:

    foomod_foosound.ogg

Sounds are referred to by their name with a dot, a single digit and the
file extension stripped out. When a sound is played, the actual sound file
is chosen randomly from the matching sounds.

When playing the sound `foomod_foosound`, the sound is chosen randomly
from the available ones of the following files:

* `foomod_foosound.ogg`
* `foomod_foosound.0.ogg`
* `foomod_foosound.1.ogg`
* (...)
* `foomod_foosound.9.ogg`

Examples of sound parameter tables:

    -- Play locationless on all clients
    {
        gain = 1.0,   -- default
        fade = 0.0,   -- default, change to a value > 0 to fade the sound in
        pitch = 1.0,  -- default
    }
    -- Play locationless to one player
    {
        to_player = name,
        gain = 1.0,   -- default
        fade = 0.0,   -- default, change to a value > 0 to fade the sound in
        pitch = 1.0,  -- default
    }
    -- Play locationless to one player, looped
    {
        to_player = name,
        gain = 1.0,  -- default
        loop = true,
    }
    -- Play at a location
    {
        pos = {x = 1, y = 2, z = 3},
        gain = 1.0,  -- default
        max_hear_distance = 32,  -- default, uses an euclidean metric
    }
    -- Play connected to an object, looped
    {
        object = <an ObjectRef>,
        gain = 1.0,  -- default
        max_hear_distance = 32,  -- default, uses an euclidean metric
        loop = true,
    }
    -- Play at a location, heard by anyone *but* the given player
    {
        pos = {x = 32, y = 0, z = 100},
        max_hear_distance = 40,
        exclude_player = name,
    }

Looped sounds must either be connected to an object or played locationless to
one player using `to_player = name`.

A positional sound will only be heard by players that are within
`max_hear_distance` of the sound position, at the start of the sound.

`exclude_player = name` can be applied to locationless, positional and object-
bound sounds to exclude a single player from hearing them.

`SimpleSoundSpec`
-----------------

Specifies a sound name, gain (=volume) and pitch.
This is either a string or a table.

In string form, you just specify the sound name or
the empty string for no sound.

Table form has the following fields:

* `name`: Sound name
* `gain`: Volume (`1.0` = 100%)
* `pitch`: Pitch (`1.0` = 100%)

`gain` and `pitch` are optional and default to `1.0`.

Examples:

* `""`: No sound
* `{}`: No sound
* `"default_place_node"`: Play e.g. `default_place_node.ogg`
* `{name = "default_place_node"}`: Same as above
* `{name = "default_place_node", gain = 0.5}`: 50% volume
* `{name = "default_place_node", gain = 0.9, pitch = 1.1}`: 90% volume, 110% pitch

Special sound files
-------------------

These sound files are played back by the engine if provided.

 * `player_damage`: Played when the local player takes damage (gain = 0.5)
 * `player_falling_damage`: Played when the local player takes
   damage by falling (gain = 0.5)
 * `player_jump`: Played when the local player jumps
 * `default_dig_<groupname>`: Default node digging sound
   (see node sound definition for details)

Registered definitions
======================

Anything added using certain [Registration functions] gets added to one or more
of the global [Registered definition tables].

Note that in some cases you will stumble upon things that are not contained
in these tables (e.g. when a mod has been removed). Always check for
existence before trying to access the fields.

Example:

All nodes register with `minetest.register_node` get added to the table
`minetest.registered_nodes`.

If you want to check the drawtype of a node, you could do:

    local function get_nodedef_field(nodename, fieldname)
        if not minetest.registered_nodes[nodename] then
            return nil
        end
        return minetest.registered_nodes[nodename][fieldname]
    end
    local drawtype = get_nodedef_field(nodename, "drawtype")




Nodes
=====

Nodes are the bulk data of the world: cubes and other things that take the
space of a cube. Huge amounts of them are handled efficiently, but they
are quite static.

The definition of a node is stored and can be accessed by using

    minetest.registered_nodes[node.name]

See [Registered definitions].

Nodes are passed by value between Lua and the engine.
They are represented by a table:

    {name="name", param1=num, param2=num}

`param1` and `param2` are 8-bit integers ranging from 0 to 255. The engine uses
them for certain automated functions. If you don't use these functions, you can
use them to store arbitrary values.

Node paramtypes
---------------

The functions of `param1` and `param2` are determined by certain fields in the
node definition.

The function of `param1` is determined by `paramtype` in node definition.
`param1` is reserved for the engine when `paramtype != "none"`.

* `paramtype = "light"`
    * The value stores light with and without sun in its upper and lower 4 bits
      respectively.
    * Required by a light source node to enable spreading its light.
    * Required by the following drawtypes as they determine their visual
      brightness from their internal light value:
        * torchlike
        * signlike
        * firelike
        * fencelike
        * raillike
        * nodebox
        * mesh
        * plantlike
        * plantlike_rooted
* `paramtype = "none"`
    * `param1` will not be used by the engine and can be used to store
      an arbitrary value

The function of `param2` is determined by `paramtype2` in node definition.
`param2` is reserved for the engine when `paramtype2 != "none"`.

* `paramtype2 = "flowingliquid"`
    * Used by `drawtype = "flowingliquid"` and `liquidtype = "flowing"`
    * The liquid level and a flag of the liquid are stored in `param2`
    * Bits 0-2: Liquid level (0-7). The higher, the more liquid is in this node;
      see `minetest.get_node_level`, `minetest.set_node_level` and `minetest.add_node_level`
      to access/manipulate the content of this field
    * Bit 3: If set, liquid is flowing downwards (no graphical effect)
* `paramtype2 = "wallmounted"`
    * Supported drawtypes: "torchlike", "signlike", "normal", "nodebox", "mesh"
    * The rotation of the node is stored in `param2`
    * You can make this value by using `minetest.dir_to_wallmounted()`
    * Values range 0 - 5
    * The value denotes at which direction the node is "mounted":
      0 = y+,   1 = y-,   2 = x+,   3 = x-,   4 = z+,   5 = z-
* `paramtype2 = "facedir"`
    * Supported drawtypes: "normal", "nodebox", "mesh"
    * The rotation of the node is stored in `param2`. Furnaces and chests are
      rotated this way. Can be made by using `minetest.dir_to_facedir()`.
    * Values range 0 - 23
    * facedir / 4 = axis direction:
      0 = y+,   1 = z+,   2 = z-,   3 = x+,   4 = x-,   5 = y-
    * facedir modulo 4 = rotation around that axis
* `paramtype2 = "leveled"`
    * Only valid for "nodebox" with 'type = "leveled"', and "plantlike_rooted".
        * Leveled nodebox:
            * The level of the top face of the nodebox is stored in `param2`.
            * The other faces are defined by 'fixed = {}' like 'type = "fixed"'
              nodeboxes.
            * The nodebox height is (`param2` / 64) nodes.
            * The maximum accepted value of `param2` is 127.
        * Rooted plantlike:
            * The height of the 'plantlike' section is stored in `param2`.
            * The height is (`param2` / 16) nodes.
* `paramtype2 = "degrotate"`
    * Only valid for "plantlike" drawtype. The rotation of the node is stored in
      `param2`.
    * Values range 0 - 179. The value stored in `param2` is multiplied by two to
      get the actual rotation in degrees of the node.
* `paramtype2 = "meshoptions"`
    * Only valid for "plantlike" drawtype. `param2` encodes the shape and
      optional modifiers of the "plant". `param2` is a bitfield.
    * Bits 0 to 2 select the shape.
      Use only one of the values below:
        * 0 = a "x" shaped plant (ordinary plant)
        * 1 = a "+" shaped plant (just rotated 45 degrees)
        * 2 = a "*" shaped plant with 3 faces instead of 2
        * 3 = a "#" shaped plant with 4 faces instead of 2
        * 4 = a "#" shaped plant with 4 faces that lean outwards
        * 5-7 are unused and reserved for future meshes.
    * Bits 3 to 7 are used to enable any number of optional modifiers.
      Just add the corresponding value(s) below to `param2`:
        * 8  - Makes the plant slightly vary placement horizontally
        * 16 - Makes the plant mesh 1.4x larger
        * 32 - Moves each face randomly a small bit down (1/8 max)
        * values 64 and 128 (bits 6-7) are reserved for future use.
    * Example: `param2 = 0` selects a normal "x" shaped plant
    * Example: `param2 = 17` selects a "+" shaped plant, 1.4x larger (1+16)
* `paramtype2 = "color"`
    * `param2` tells which color is picked from the palette.
      The palette should have 256 pixels.
* `paramtype2 = "colorfacedir"`
    * Same as `facedir`, but with colors.
    * The first three bits of `param2` tells which color is picked from the
      palette. The palette should have 8 pixels.
* `paramtype2 = "colorwallmounted"`
    * Same as `wallmounted`, but with colors.
    * The first five bits of `param2` tells which color is picked from the
      palette. The palette should have 32 pixels.
* `paramtype2 = "glasslikeliquidlevel"`
    * Only valid for "glasslike_framed" or "glasslike_framed_optional"
      drawtypes.
    * `param2` values 0-63 define 64 levels of internal liquid, 0 being empty
      and 63 being full.
    * Liquid texture is defined using `special_tiles = {"modname_tilename.png"}`
* `paramtype2 = "none"`
    * `param2` will not be used by the engine and can be used to store
      an arbitrary value

Nodes can also contain extra data. See [Node Metadata].

Node drawtypes
--------------

There are a bunch of different looking node types.

Look for examples in `games/devtest` or `games/minetest_game`.

* `normal`
    * A node-sized cube.
* `airlike`
    * Invisible, uses no texture.
* `liquid`
    * The cubic source node for a liquid.
* `flowingliquid`
    * The flowing version of a liquid, appears with various heights and slopes.
* `glasslike`
    * Often used for partially-transparent nodes.
    * Only external sides of textures are visible.
* `glasslike_framed`
    * All face-connected nodes are drawn as one volume within a surrounding
      frame.
    * The frame appearance is generated from the edges of the first texture
      specified in `tiles`. The width of the edges used are 1/16th of texture
      size: 1 pixel for 16x16, 2 pixels for 32x32 etc.
    * The glass 'shine' (or other desired detail) on each node face is supplied
      by the second texture specified in `tiles`.
* `glasslike_framed_optional`
    * This switches between the above 2 drawtypes according to the menu setting
      'Connected Glass'.
* `allfaces`
    * Often used for partially-transparent nodes.
    * External and internal sides of textures are visible.
* `allfaces_optional`
    * Often used for leaves nodes.
    * This switches between `normal`, `glasslike` and `allfaces` according to
      the menu setting: Opaque Leaves / Simple Leaves / Fancy Leaves.
    * With 'Simple Leaves' selected, the texture specified in `special_tiles`
      is used instead, if present. This allows a visually thicker texture to be
      used to compensate for how `glasslike` reduces visual thickness.
* `torchlike`
    * A single vertical texture.
    * If placed on top of a node, uses the first texture specified in `tiles`.
    * If placed against the underside of a node, uses the second texture
      specified in `tiles`.
    * If placed on the side of a node, uses the third texture specified in
      `tiles` and is perpendicular to that node.
* `signlike`
    * A single texture parallel to, and mounted against, the top, underside or
      side of a node.
* `plantlike`
    * Two vertical and diagonal textures at right-angles to each other.
    * See `paramtype2 = "meshoptions"` above for other options.
* `firelike`
    * When above a flat surface, appears as 6 textures, the central 2 as
      `plantlike` plus 4 more surrounding those.
    * If not above a surface the central 2 do not appear, but the texture
      appears against the faces of surrounding nodes if they are present.
* `fencelike`
    * A 3D model suitable for a wooden fence.
    * One placed node appears as a single vertical post.
    * Adjacently-placed nodes cause horizontal bars to appear between them.
* `raillike`
    * Often used for tracks for mining carts.
    * Requires 4 textures to be specified in `tiles`, in order: Straight,
      curved, t-junction, crossing.
    * Each placed node automatically switches to a suitable rotated texture
      determined by the adjacent `raillike` nodes, in order to create a
      continuous track network.
    * Becomes a sloping node if placed against stepped nodes.
* `nodebox`
    * Often used for stairs and slabs.
    * Allows defining nodes consisting of an arbitrary number of boxes.
    * See [Node boxes] below for more information.
* `mesh`
    * Uses models for nodes.
    * Tiles should hold model materials textures.
    * Only static meshes are implemented.
    * For supported model formats see Irrlicht engine documentation.
* `plantlike_rooted`
    * Enables underwater `plantlike` without air bubbles around the nodes.
    * Consists of a base cube at the co-ordinates of the node plus a
      `plantlike` extension above with a height of `param2 / 16` nodes.
    * The `plantlike` extension visually passes through any nodes above the
      base cube without affecting them.
    * The base cube texture tiles are defined as normal, the `plantlike`
      extension uses the defined special tile, for example:
      `special_tiles = {{name = "default_papyrus.png"}},`

`*_optional` drawtypes need less rendering time if deactivated
(always client-side).

Node boxes
----------

Node selection boxes are defined using "node boxes".

A nodebox is defined as any of:

    {
        -- A normal cube; the default in most things
        type = "regular"
    }
    {
        -- A fixed box (or boxes) (facedir param2 is used, if applicable)
        type = "fixed",
        fixed = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
    }
    {
        -- A variable height box (or boxes) with the top face position defined
        -- by the node parameter 'leveled = ', or if 'paramtype2 == "leveled"'
        -- by param2.
        -- Other faces are defined by 'fixed = {}' as with 'type = "fixed"'.
        type = "leveled",
        fixed = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
    }
    {
        -- A box like the selection box for torches
        -- (wallmounted param2 is used, if applicable)
        type = "wallmounted",
        wall_top = box,
        wall_bottom = box,
        wall_side = box
    }
    {
        -- A node that has optional boxes depending on neighbouring nodes'
        -- presence and type. See also `connects_to`.
        type = "connected",
        fixed = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_top = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_bottom = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_front = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_left = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_back = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_right = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        -- The following `disconnected_*` boxes are the opposites of the
        -- `connect_*` ones above, i.e. when a node has no suitable neighbour
        -- on the respective side, the corresponding disconnected box is drawn.
        disconnected_top = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        disconnected_bottom = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        disconnected_front = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        disconnected_left = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        disconnected_back = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        disconnected_right = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        disconnected = box OR {box1, box2, ...} -- when there is *no* neighbour
        disconnected_sides = box OR {box1, box2, ...} -- when there are *no*
                                                      -- neighbours to the sides
    }

A `box` is defined as:

    {x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2}

A box of a regular node would look like:

    {-0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5},

To avoid collision issues, keep each value within the range of +/- 1.45.
This also applies to leveled nodeboxes, where the final height shall not
exceed this soft limit.



Map terminology and coordinates
===============================

Nodes, mapblocks, mapchunks
---------------------------

A 'node' is the fundamental cubic unit of a world and appears to a player as
roughly 1x1x1 meters in size.

A 'mapblock' (often abbreviated to 'block') is 16x16x16 nodes and is the
fundamental region of a world that is stored in the world database, sent to
clients and handled by many parts of the engine.
'mapblock' is preferred terminology to 'block' to help avoid confusion with
'node', however 'block' often appears in the API.

A 'mapchunk' (sometimes abbreviated to 'chunk') is usually 5x5x5 mapblocks
(80x80x80 nodes) and is the volume of world generated in one operation by
the map generator.
The size in mapblocks has been chosen to optimise map generation.

Coordinates
-----------

### Orientation of axes

For node and mapblock coordinates, +X is East, +Y is up, +Z is North.

### Node coordinates

Almost all positions used in the API use node coordinates.

### Mapblock coordinates

Occasionally the API uses 'blockpos' which refers to mapblock coordinates that
specify a particular mapblock.
For example blockpos (0,0,0) specifies the mapblock that extends from
node position (0,0,0) to node position (15,15,15).

#### Converting node position to the containing blockpos

To calculate the blockpos of the mapblock that contains the node at 'nodepos',
for each axis:

* blockpos = math.floor(nodepos / 16)

#### Converting blockpos to min/max node positions

To calculate the min/max node positions contained in the mapblock at 'blockpos',
for each axis:

* Minimum:
  nodepos = blockpos * 16
* Maximum:
  nodepos = blockpos * 16 + 15




HUD
===

HUD element types
-----------------

The position field is used for all element types.

To account for differing resolutions, the position coordinates are the
percentage of the screen, ranging in value from `0` to `1`.

The name field is not yet used, but should contain a description of what the
HUD element represents.

The `direction` field is the direction in which something is drawn.
`0` draws from left to right, `1` draws from right to left, `2` draws from
top to bottom, and `3` draws from bottom to top.

The `alignment` field specifies how the item will be aligned. It is a table
where `x` and `y` range from `-1` to `1`, with `0` being central. `-1` is
moved to the left/up, and `1` is to the right/down. Fractional values can be
used.

The `offset` field specifies a pixel offset from the position. Contrary to
position, the offset is not scaled to screen size. This allows for some
precisely positioned items in the HUD.

**Note**: `offset` _will_ adapt to screen DPI as well as user defined scaling
factor!

The `z_index` field specifies the order of HUD elements from back to front.
Lower z-index elements are displayed behind higher z-index elements. Elements
with same z-index are displayed in an arbitrary order. Default 0.
Supports negative values. By convention, the following values are recommended:

*  -400: Graphical effects, such as vignette
*  -300: Name tags, waypoints
*  -200: Wieldhand
*  -100: Things that block the player's view, e.g. masks
*     0: Default. For standard in-game HUD elements like crosshair, hotbar,
         minimap, builtin statbars, etc.
*   100: Temporary text messages or notification icons
*  1000: Full-screen effects such as full-black screen or credits.
         This includes effects that cover the entire screen
* Other: If your HUD element doesn't fit into any category, pick a number
         between the suggested values



Below are the specific uses for fields in each type; fields not listed for that
type are ignored.

### `image`

Displays an image on the HUD.

* `scale`: The scale of the image, with 1 being the original texture size.
  Only the X coordinate scale is used (positive values).
  Negative values represent that percentage of the screen it
  should take; e.g. `x=-100` means 100% (width).
* `text`: The name of the texture that is displayed.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the image.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `text`

Displays text on the HUD.

* `scale`: Defines the bounding rectangle of the text.
  A value such as `{x=100, y=100}` should work.
* `text`: The text to be displayed in the HUD element.
* `number`: An integer containing the RGB value of the color used to draw the
  text. Specify `0xFFFFFF` for white text, `0xFF0000` for red, and so on.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the text.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.
* `size`: size of the text.
  The player-set font size is multiplied by size.x (y value isn't used).

### `statbar`

Displays a horizontal bar made up of half-images with an optional background.

* `text`: The name of the texture to use.
* `text2`: Optional texture name to enable a background / "off state"
  texture (useful to visualize the maximal value). Both textures
  must have the same size.
* `number`: The number of half-textures that are displayed.
  If odd, will end with a vertically center-split texture.
* `item`: Same as `number` but for the "off state" texture
* `direction`: To which direction the images will extend to
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.
* `size`: If used, will force full-image size to this value (override texture
  pack image size)

### `inventory`

* `text`: The name of the inventory list to be displayed.
* `number`: Number of items in the inventory to be displayed.
* `item`: Position of item that is selected.
* `direction`
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `waypoint`

Displays distance to selected world position.

* `name`: The name of the waypoint.
* `text`: Distance suffix. Can be blank.
* `precision`: Waypoint precision, integer >= 0. Defaults to 10.
  If set to 0, distance is not shown. Shown value is `floor(distance*precision)/precision`.
  When the precision is an integer multiple of 10, there will be `log_10(precision)` digits after the decimal point.
  `precision = 1000`, for example, will show 3 decimal places (eg: `0.999`).
  `precision = 2` will show multiples of `0.5`; precision = 5 will show multiples of `0.2` and so on:
  `precision = n` will show multiples of `1/n`
* `number:` An integer containing the RGB value of the color used to draw the
  text.
* `world_pos`: World position of the waypoint.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the waypoint.

### `image_waypoint`

Same as `image`, but does not accept a `position`; the position is instead determined by `world_pos`, the world position of the waypoint.

* `scale`: The scale of the image, with 1 being the original texture size.
  Only the X coordinate scale is used (positive values).
  Negative values represent that percentage of the screen it
  should take; e.g. `x=-100` means 100% (width).
* `text`: The name of the texture that is displayed.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the image.
* `world_pos`: World position of the waypoint.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `compass`

Displays an image oriented or translated according to current heading direction.

* `size`: The size of this element. Negative values represent percentage
  of the screen; e.g. `x=-100` means 100% (width).
* `scale`: Scale of the translated image (used only for dir = 2 or dir = 3).
* `text`: The name of the texture to use.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the image.
* `offset`: Offset in pixels from position.
* `dir`: How the image is rotated/translated:
  * 0 - Rotate as heading direction
  * 1 - Rotate in reverse direction
  * 2 - Translate as landscape direction
  * 3 - Translate in reverse direction

If translation is chosen, texture is repeated horizontally to fill the whole element.

### `minimap`

Displays a minimap on the HUD.

* `size`: Size of the minimap to display. Minimap should be a square to avoid
  distortion.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the minimap.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

Representations of simple things
================================

Position/vector
---------------

    {x=num, y=num, z=num}

For helper functions see [Spatial Vectors].

`pointed_thing`
---------------

* `{type="nothing"}`
* `{type="node", under=pos, above=pos}`
    * Indicates a pointed node selection box.
    * `under` refers to the node position behind the pointed face.
    * `above` refers to the node position in front of the pointed face.
* `{type="object", ref=ObjectRef}`

Exact pointing location (currently only `Raycast` supports these fields):

* `pointed_thing.intersection_point`: The absolute world coordinates of the
  point on the selection box which is pointed at. May be in the selection box
  if the pointer is in the box too.
* `pointed_thing.box_id`: The ID of the pointed selection box (counting starts
  from 1).
* `pointed_thing.intersection_normal`: Unit vector, points outwards of the
  selected selection box. This specifies which face is pointed at.
  Is a null vector `{x = 0, y = 0, z = 0}` when the pointer is inside the
  selection box.




Flag Specifier Format
=====================

Flags using the standardized flag specifier format can be specified in either
of two ways, by string or table.

The string format is a comma-delimited set of flag names; whitespace and
unrecognized flag fields are ignored. Specifying a flag in the string sets the
flag, and specifying a flag prefixed by the string `"no"` explicitly
clears the flag from whatever the default may be.

In addition to the standard string flag format, the schematic flags field can
also be a table of flag names to boolean values representing whether or not the
flag is set. Additionally, if a field with the flag name prefixed with `"no"`
is present, mapped to a boolean of any value, the specified flag is unset.

E.g. A flag field of value

    {place_center_x = true, place_center_y=false, place_center_z=true}

is equivalent to

    {place_center_x = true, noplace_center_y=true, place_center_z=true}

which is equivalent to

    "place_center_x, noplace_center_y, place_center_z"

or even

    "place_center_x, place_center_z"

since, by default, no schematic attributes are set.




Items
=====

Item types
----------

There are three kinds of items: nodes, tools and craftitems.

* Node: Can be placed in the world's voxel grid
* Tool: Has a wear property but cannot be stacked. The default use action is to
  dig nodes or hit objects according to its tool capabilities.
* Craftitem: Cannot dig nodes or be placed

Amount and wear
---------------

All item stacks have an amount between 0 and 65535. It is 1 by
default. Tool item stacks can not have an amount greater than 1.

Tools use a wear (damage) value ranging from 0 to 65535. The
value 0 is the default and is used for unworn tools. The values
1 to 65535 are used for worn tools, where a higher value stands for
a higher wear. Non-tools always have a wear value of 0.

Item formats
------------

Items and item stacks can exist in three formats: Serializes, table format
and `ItemStack`.

When an item must be passed to a function, it can usually be in any of
these formats.

### Serialized

This is called "stackstring" or "itemstring". It is a simple string with
1-3 components: the full item identifier, an optional amount and an optional
wear value. Syntax:

    <identifier> [<amount>[ <wear>]]

Examples:

* `'default:apple'`: 1 apple
* `'default:dirt 5'`: 5 dirt
* `'default:pick_stone'`: a new stone pickaxe
* `'default:pick_wood 1 21323'`: a wooden pickaxe, ca. 1/3 worn out

### Table format

Examples:

5 dirt nodes:

    {name="default:dirt", count=5, wear=0, metadata=""}

A wooden pick about 1/3 worn out:

    {name="default:pick_wood", count=1, wear=21323, metadata=""}

An apple:

    {name="default:apple", count=1, wear=0, metadata=""}

### `ItemStack`

A native C++ format with many helper methods. Useful for converting
between formats. See the [Class reference] section for details.




Groups
======

In a number of places, there is a group table. Groups define the
properties of a thing (item, node, armor of entity, capabilities of
tool) in such a way that the engine and other mods can can interact with
the thing without actually knowing what the thing is.

Usage
-----

Groups are stored in a table, having the group names with keys and the
group ratings as values. Group ratings are integer values within the
range [-32767, 32767]. For example:

    -- Default dirt
    groups = {crumbly=3, soil=1}

    -- A more special dirt-kind of thing
    groups = {crumbly=2, soil=1, level=2, outerspace=1}

Groups always have a rating associated with them. If there is no
useful meaning for a rating for an enabled group, it shall be `1`.

When not defined, the rating of a group defaults to `0`. Thus when you
read groups, you must interpret `nil` and `0` as the same value, `0`.

You can read the rating of a group for an item or a node by using

    minetest.get_item_group(itemname, groupname)

Groups of items
---------------

Groups of items can define what kind of an item it is (e.g. wool).

Groups of nodes
---------------

In addition to the general item things, groups are used to define whether
a node is destroyable and how long it takes to destroy by a tool.

Groups of entities
------------------

For entities, groups are, as of now, used only for calculating damage.
The rating is the percentage of damage caused by tools with this damage group.
See [Entity damage mechanism].

    object.get_armor_groups() --> a group-rating table (e.g. {fleshy=100})
    object.set_armor_groups({fleshy=30, cracky=80})

Groups of tools
---------------

Groups in tools define which groups of nodes and entities they are
effective towards.

Groups in crafting recipes
--------------------------

An example: Make meat soup from any meat, any water and any bowl:

    {
        output = 'food:meat_soup_raw',
        recipe = {
            {'group:meat'},
            {'group:water'},
            {'group:bowl'},
        },
        -- preserve = {'group:bowl'}, -- Not implemented yet (TODO)
    }

Another example: Make red wool from white wool and red dye:

    {
        type = 'shapeless',
        output = 'wool:red',
        recipe = {'wool:white', 'group:dye,basecolor_red'},
    }

Special groups
--------------

The asterisk `(*)` after a group name describes that there is no engine
functionality bound to it, and implementation is left up as a suggestion
to games.

### Node, item and tool groups

* `not_in_creative_inventory`: (*) Special group for inventory mods to indicate
  that the item should be hidden in item lists.


### Node-only groups

* `attached_node`: if the node under it is not a walkable block the node will be
  dropped as an item. If the node is wallmounted the wallmounted direction is
  checked.
* `bouncy`: value is bounce speed in percent
* `connect_to_raillike`: makes nodes of raillike drawtype with same group value
  connect to each other
* `dig_immediate`: Player can always pick up node without reducing tool wear
    * `2`: the node always gets the digging time 0.5 seconds (rail, sign)
    * `3`: the node always gets the digging time 0 seconds (torch)
* `disable_jump`: Player (and possibly other things) cannot jump from node
  or if their feet are in the node. Note: not supported for `new_move = false`
* `fall_damage_add_percent`: damage speed = `speed * (1 + value/100)`
* `falling_node`: if there is no walkable block under the node it will fall
* `float`: the node will not fall through liquids
* `level`: Can be used to give an additional sense of progression in the game.
     * A larger level will cause e.g. a weapon of a lower level make much less
       damage, and get worn out much faster, or not be able to get drops
       from destroyed nodes.
     * `0` is something that is directly accessible at the start of gameplay
     * There is no upper limit
     * See also: `leveldiff` in [Tools]
* `slippery`: Players and items will slide on the node.
  Slipperiness rises steadily with `slippery` value, starting at 1.


### Tool-only groups

* `disable_repair`: If set to 1 for a tool, it cannot be repaired using the
  `"toolrepair"` crafting recipe


### `ObjectRef` groups

* `immortal`: Skips all damage and breath handling for an object. This group
  will also hide the integrated HUD status bars for players. It is
  automatically set to all players when damage is disabled on the server and
  cannot be reset (subject to change).
* `punch_operable`: For entities; disables the regular damage mechanism for
  players punching it by hand or a non-tool item, so that it can do something
  else than take damage.



Known damage and digging time defining groups
---------------------------------------------

* `crumbly`: dirt, sand
* `cracky`: tough but crackable stuff like stone.
* `snappy`: something that can be cut using fine tools; e.g. leaves, small
  plants, wire, sheets of metal
* `choppy`: something that can be cut using force; e.g. trees, wooden planks
* `fleshy`: Living things like animals and the player. This could imply
  some blood effects when hitting.
* `explody`: Especially prone to explosions
* `oddly_breakable_by_hand`:
   Can be added to nodes that shouldn't logically be breakable by the
   hand but are. Somewhat similar to `dig_immediate`, but times are more
   like `{[1]=3.50,[2]=2.00,[3]=0.70}` and this does not override the
   speed of a tool if the tool can dig at a faster speed than this
   suggests for the hand.

Examples of custom groups
-------------------------

Item groups are often used for defining, well, _groups of items_.

* `meat`: any meat-kind of a thing (rating might define the size or healing
  ability or be irrelevant -- it is not defined as of yet)
* `eatable`: anything that can be eaten. Rating might define HP gain in half
  hearts.
* `flammable`: can be set on fire. Rating might define the intensity of the
  fire, affecting e.g. the speed of the spreading of an open fire.
* `wool`: any wool (any origin, any color)
* `metal`: any metal
* `weapon`: any weapon
* `heavy`: anything considerably heavy

Digging time calculation specifics
----------------------------------

Groups such as `crumbly`, `cracky` and `snappy` are used for this
purpose. Rating is `1`, `2` or `3`. A higher rating for such a group implies
faster digging time.

The `level` group is used to limit the toughness of nodes a tool can dig
and to scale the digging times / damage to a greater extent.

**Please do understand this**, otherwise you cannot use the system to it's
full potential.

Tools define their properties by a list of parameters for groups. They
cannot dig other groups; thus it is important to use a standard bunch of
groups to enable interaction with tools.




Tools
=====

Tools definition
----------------

Tools define:

* Full punch interval
* Maximum drop level
* For an arbitrary list of groups:
    * Uses (until the tool breaks)
        * Maximum level (usually `0`, `1`, `2` or `3`)
        * Digging times
        * Damage groups

### Full punch interval

When used as a weapon, the tool will do full damage if this time is spent
between punches. If e.g. half the time is spent, the tool will do half
damage.

### Maximum drop level

Suggests the maximum level of node, when dug with the tool, that will drop
it's useful item. (e.g. iron ore to drop a lump of iron).

This is not automated; it is the responsibility of the node definition
to implement this.

### Uses

Determines how many uses the tool has when it is used for digging a node,
of this group, of the maximum level. For lower leveled nodes, the use count
is multiplied by `3^leveldiff`.
`leveldiff` is the difference of the tool's `maxlevel` `groupcaps` and the
node's `level` group. The node cannot be dug if `leveldiff` is less than zero.

* `uses=10, leveldiff=0`: actual uses: 10
* `uses=10, leveldiff=1`: actual uses: 30
* `uses=10, leveldiff=2`: actual uses: 90

### Maximum level

Tells what is the maximum level of a node of this group that the tool will
be able to dig.

### Digging times

List of digging times for different ratings of the group, for nodes of the
maximum level.

For example, as a Lua table, `times={2=2.00, 3=0.70}`. This would
result in the tool to be able to dig nodes that have a rating of `2` or `3`
for this group, and unable to dig the rating `1`, which is the toughest.
Unless there is a matching group that enables digging otherwise.

If the result digging time is 0, a delay of 0.15 seconds is added between
digging nodes; If the player releases LMB after digging, this delay is set to 0,
i.e. players can more quickly click the nodes away instead of holding LMB.

### Damage groups

List of damage for groups of entities. See [Entity damage mechanism].

Example definition of the capabilities of a tool
------------------------------------------------

    tool_capabilities = {
        full_punch_interval=1.5,
        max_drop_level=1,
        groupcaps={
            crumbly={maxlevel=2, uses=20, times={[1]=1.60, [2]=1.20, [3]=0.80}}
        }
        damage_groups = {fleshy=2},
    }

This makes the tool be able to dig nodes that fulfil both of these:

* Have the `crumbly` group
* Have a `level` group less or equal to `2`

Table of resulting digging times:

    crumbly        0     1     2     3     4  <- level
         ->  0     -     -     -     -     -
             1  0.80  1.60  1.60     -     -
             2  0.60  1.20  1.20     -     -
             3  0.40  0.80  0.80     -     -

    level diff:    2     1     0    -1    -2

Table of resulting tool uses:

    ->  0     -     -     -     -     -
        1   180    60    20     -     -
        2   180    60    20     -     -
        3   180    60    20     -     -

**Notes**:

* At `crumbly==0`, the node is not diggable.
* At `crumbly==3`, the level difference digging time divider kicks in and makes
  easy nodes to be quickly breakable.
* At `level > 2`, the node is not diggable, because it's `level > maxlevel`




Entity damage mechanism
=======================

Damage calculation:

    damage = 0
    foreach group in cap.damage_groups:
        damage += cap.damage_groups[group]
            * limit(actual_interval / cap.full_punch_interval, 0.0, 1.0)
            * (object.armor_groups[group] / 100.0)
            -- Where object.armor_groups[group] is 0 for inexistent values
    return damage

Client predicts damage based on damage groups. Because of this, it is able to
give an immediate response when an entity is damaged or dies; the response is
pre-defined somehow (e.g. by defining a sprite animation) (not implemented;
TODO).
Currently a smoke puff will appear when an entity dies.

The group `immortal` completely disables normal damage.

Entities can define a special armor group, which is `punch_operable`. This
group disables the regular damage mechanism for players punching it by hand or
a non-tool item, so that it can do something else than take damage.

On the Lua side, every punch calls:

    entity:on_punch(puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction,
                    damage)

This should never be called directly, because damage is usually not handled by
the entity itself.

* `puncher` is the object performing the punch. Can be `nil`. Should never be
  accessed unless absolutely required, to encourage interoperability.
* `time_from_last_punch` is time from last punch (by `puncher`) or `nil`.
* `tool_capabilities` can be `nil`.
* `direction` is a unit vector, pointing from the source of the punch to
   the punched object.
* `damage` damage that will be done to entity
Return value of this function will determine if damage is done by this function
(retval true) or shall be done by engine (retval false)

To punch an entity/object in Lua, call:

  object:punch(puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction)

* Return value is tool wear.
* Parameters are equal to the above callback.
* If `direction` equals `nil` and `puncher` does not equal `nil`, `direction`
  will be automatically filled in based on the location of `puncher`.




Metadata
========

Node Metadata
-------------

The instance of a node in the world normally only contains the three values
mentioned in [Nodes]. However, it is possible to insert extra data into a node.
It is called "node metadata"; See `NodeMetaRef`.

Node metadata contains two things:

* A key-value store
* An inventory

Some of the values in the key-value store are handled specially:

* `formspec`: Defines a right-click inventory menu. See [Formspec].
* `infotext`: Text shown on the screen when the node is pointed at

Example:

    local meta = minetest.get_meta(pos)
    meta:set_string("formspec",
            "size[8,9]"..
            "list[context;main;0,0;8,4;]"..
            "list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]")
    meta:set_string("infotext", "Chest");
    local inv = meta:get_inventory()
    inv:set_size("main", 8*4)
    print(dump(meta:to_table()))
    meta:from_table({
        inventory = {
            main = {[1] = "default:dirt", [2] = "", [3] = "", [4] = "",
                    [5] = "", [6] = "", [7] = "", [8] = "", [9] = "",
                    [10] = "", [11] = "", [12] = "", [13] = "",
                    [14] = "default:cobble", [15] = "", [16] = "", [17] = "",
                    [18] = "", [19] = "", [20] = "default:cobble", [21] = "",
                    [22] = "", [23] = "", [24] = "", [25] = "", [26] = "",
                    [27] = "", [28] = "", [29] = "", [30] = "", [31] = "",
                    [32] = ""}
        },
        fields = {
            formspec = "size[8,9]list[context;main;0,0;8,4;]list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]",
            infotext = "Chest"
        }
    })

Item Metadata
-------------

Item stacks can store metadata too. See [`ItemStackMetaRef`].

Item metadata only contains a key-value store.

Some of the values in the key-value store are handled specially:

* `description`: Set the item stack's description.
  See also: `get_description` in [`ItemStack`]
* `short_description`: Set the item stack's short description.
  See also: `get_short_description` in [`ItemStack`]
* `color`: A `ColorString`, which sets the stack's color.
* `palette_index`: If the item has a palette, this is used to get the
  current color from the palette.

Example:

    local meta = stack:get_meta()
    meta:set_string("key", "value")
    print(dump(meta:to_table()))




Formspec
========

Formspec defines a menu. This supports inventories and some of the
typical widgets like buttons, checkboxes, text input fields, etc.
It is a string, with a somewhat strange format.

A formspec is made out of formspec elements, which includes widgets
like buttons but also can be used to set stuff like background color.

Many formspec elements have a `name`, which is a unique identifier which
is used when the server receives user input. You must not use the name
"quit" for formspec elements.

Spaces and newlines can be inserted between the blocks, as is used in the
examples.

Position and size units are inventory slots unless the new coordinate system
is enabled. `X` and `Y` position the formspec element relative to the top left
of the menu or container. `W` and `H` are its width and height values.

If the new system is enabled, all elements have unified coordinates for all
elements with no padding or spacing in between. This is highly recommended
for new forms. See `real_coordinates[<bool>]` and `Migrating to Real
Coordinates`.

Inventories with a `player:<name>` inventory location are only sent to the
player named `<name>`.

When displaying text which can contain formspec code, e.g. text set by a player,
use `minetest.formspec_escape`.
For coloured text you can use `minetest.colorize`.

Since formspec version 3, elements drawn in the order they are defined. All
background elements are drawn before all other elements.

**WARNING**: do _not_ use a element name starting with `key_`; those names are
reserved to pass key press events to formspec!

**WARNING**: Minetest allows you to add elements to every single formspec instance
using `player:set_formspec_prepend()`, which may be the reason backgrounds are
appearing when you don't expect them to, or why things are styled differently
to normal. See [`no_prepend[]`] and [Styling Formspecs].

Examples
--------

### Chest

    size[8,9]
    list[context;main;0,0;8,4;]
    list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]

### Furnace

    size[8,9]
    list[context;fuel;2,3;1,1;]
    list[context;src;2,1;1,1;]
    list[context;dst;5,1;2,2;]
    list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]

### Minecraft-like player inventory

    size[8,7.5]
    image[1,0.6;1,2;player.png]
    list[current_player;main;0,3.5;8,4;]
    list[current_player;craft;3,0;3,3;]
    list[current_player;craftpreview;7,1;1,1;]

Version History
---------------

* FORMSPEC VERSION 1:
  * (too much)
* FORMSPEC VERSION 2:
  * Forced real coordinates
  * background9[]: 9-slice scaling parameters
* FORMSPEC VERSION 3:
  * Formspec elements are drawn in the order of definition
  * bgcolor[]: use 3 parameters (bgcolor, formspec (now an enum), fbgcolor)
  * box[] and image[] elements enable clipping by default
  * new element: scroll_container[]
* FORMSPEC VERSION 4:
  * Allow dropdown indexing events

Elements
--------

### `formspec_version[<version>]`

* Set the formspec version to a certain number. If not specified,
  version 1 is assumed.
* Must be specified before `size` element.
* Clients older than this version can neither show newer elements nor display
  elements with new arguments correctly.
* Available since feature `formspec_version_element`.
* See also: [Version History]

### `size[<W>,<H>,<fixed_size>]`

* Define the size of the menu in inventory slots
* `fixed_size`: `true`/`false` (optional)
* deprecated: `invsize[<W>,<H>;]`

### `position[<X>,<Y>]`

* Must be used after `size` element.
* Defines the position on the game window of the formspec's `anchor` point.
* For X and Y, 0.0 and 1.0 represent opposite edges of the game window,
  for example:
    * [0.0, 0.0] sets the position to the top left corner of the game window.
    * [1.0, 1.0] sets the position to the bottom right of the game window.
* Defaults to the center of the game window [0.5, 0.5].

### `anchor[<X>,<Y>]`

* Must be used after both `size` and `position` (if present) elements.
* Defines the location of the anchor point within the formspec.
* For X and Y, 0.0 and 1.0 represent opposite edges of the formspec,
  for example:
    * [0.0, 1.0] sets the anchor to the bottom left corner of the formspec.
    * [1.0, 0.0] sets the anchor to the top right of the formspec.
* Defaults to the center of the formspec [0.5, 0.5].

* `position` and `anchor` elements need suitable values to avoid a formspec
  extending off the game window due to particular game window sizes.

### `no_prepend[]`

* Must be used after the `size`, `position`, and `anchor` elements (if present).
* Disables player:set_formspec_prepend() from applying to this formspec.

### `real_coordinates[<bool>]`

* INFORMATION: Enable it automatically using `formspec_version` version 2 or newer.
* When set to true, all following formspec elements will use the new coordinate system.
* If used immediately after `size`, `position`, `anchor`, and `no_prepend` elements
  (if present), the form size will use the new coordinate system.
* **Note**: Formspec prepends are not affected by the coordinates in the main form.
  They must enable it explicitly.
* For information on converting forms to the new coordinate system, see `Migrating
  to Real Coordinates`.

### `container[<X>,<Y>]`

* Start of a container block, moves all physical elements in the container by
  (X, Y).
* Must have matching `container_end`
* Containers can be nested, in which case the offsets are added
  (child containers are relative to parent containers)

### `container_end[]`

* See [Styling Formspecs].


### `style_type[<selector 1>,<selector 2>;<prop1>;<prop2>;...]`

* Set the style for the element(s) matching `selector` by type.
* `selector` can be one of:

Migrating to Real Coordinates
-----------------------------

In the old system, positions included padding and spacing. Padding is a gap between
the formspec window edges and content, and spacing is the gaps between items. For
example, two `1x1` elements at `0,0` and `1,1` would have a spacing of `5/4` between them,
and a padding of `3/8` from the formspec edge. It may be easiest to recreate old layouts
in the new coordinate system from scratch.

To recreate an old layout with padding, you'll need to pass the positions and sizes
through the following formula to re-introduce padding:

```
pos = (oldpos + 1)*spacing + padding
where
    padding = 3/8
    spacing = 5/4
```

You'll need to change the `size[]` tag like this:

```
size = (oldsize-1)*spacing + padding*2 + 1
```

A few elements had random offsets in the old system. Here is a table which shows these
offsets when migrating:

| Element |  Position  |  Size   | Notes
|---------|------------|---------|-------
| box     | +0.3, +0.1 | 0, -0.4 |
| button  |            |         | Buttons now support height, so set h = 2 * 15/13 * 0.35, and reposition if h ~= 15/13 * 0.35 before
| list    |            |         | Spacing is now 0.25 for both directions, meaning lists will be taller in height
| label   | 0, +0.3    |         | The first line of text is now positioned centered exactly at the position specified

Styling Formspecs
-----------------

Formspec elements can be themed using the style elements:

    style[<name 1>,<name 2>;<prop1>;<prop2>;...]
    style[<name 1>:<state>,<name 2>:<state>;<prop1>;<prop2>;...]
    style_type[<type 1>,<type 2>;<prop1>;<prop2>;...]
    style_type[<type 1>:<state>,<type 2>:<state>;<prop1>;<prop2>;...]

Where a prop is:

    property_name=property_value

For example:

    style_type[button;bgcolor=#006699]
    style[world_delete;bgcolor=red;textcolor=yellow]
    button[4,3.95;2.6,1;world_delete;Delete]

A name/type can optionally be a comma separated list of names/types, like so:

    world_delete,world_create,world_configure
    button,image_button

A `*` type can be used to select every element in the formspec.

Any name/type in the list can also be accompanied by a `+`-separated list of states, like so:

    world_delete:hovered+pressed
    button:pressed

States allow you to apply styles in response to changes in the element, instead of applying at all times.

Setting a property to nothing will reset it to the default value. For example:

    style_type[button;bgimg=button.png;bgimg_pressed=button_pressed.png;border=false]
    style[btn_exit;bgimg=;bgimg_pressed=;border=;bgcolor=red]

Markup Language
---------------

Markup language used in `hypertext[]` elements uses tags that look like HTML tags.
The markup language is currently unstable and subject to change. Use with caution.
Some tags can enclose text, they open with `<tagname>` and close with `</tagname>`.
Tags can have attributes, in that case, attributes are in the opening tag in
form of a key/value separated with equal signs. Attribute values should not be quoted.

These are the technically basic tags but see below for usual tags. Base tags are:

`<style color=... font=... size=...>...</style>`

Changes the style of the text.

* `color`: Text color. Given color is a `colorspec`.
* `size`: Text size.
* `font`: Text font (`mono` or `normal`).

`<global background=... margin=... valign=... color=... hovercolor=... size=... font=... halign=... >`

Sets global style.

Global only styles:
* `background`: Text background, a `colorspec` or `none`.
* `margin`: Page margins in pixel.
* `valign`: Text vertical alignment (`top`, `middle`, `bottom`).

Inheriting styles (affects child elements):
* `color`: Default text color. Given color is a `colorspec`.
* `hovercolor`: Color of <action> tags when mouse is over.
* `size`: Default text size.
* `font`: Default text font (`mono` or `normal`).
* `halign`: Default text horizontal alignment (`left`, `right`, `center`, `justify`).

This tag needs to be placed only once as it changes the global settings of the
text. Anyway, if several tags are placed, each changed will be made in the order
tags appear.

`<tag name=... color=... hovercolor=... font=... size=...>`

Defines or redefines tag style. This can be used to define new tags.
* `name`: Name of the tag to define or change.
* `color`: Text color. Given color is a `colorspec`.
* `hovercolor`: Text color when element hovered (only for `action` tags). Given color is a `colorspec`.
* `size`: Text size.
* `font`: Text font (`mono` or `normal`).

Following tags are the usual tags for text layout. They are defined by default.
Other tags can be added using `<tag ...>` tag.

`<normal>...</normal>`: Normal size text

`<big>...</big>`: Big text

`<bigger>...</bigger>`: Bigger text

`<center>...</center>`: Centered text

`<left>...</left>`: Left-aligned text

`<right>...</right>`: Right-aligned text

`<justify>...</justify>`: Justified text

`<mono>...</mono>`: Monospaced font

`<b>...</b>`, `<i>...</i>`, `<u>...</u>`: Bold, italic, underline styles.

`<action name=...>...</action>`

Make that text a clickable text triggering an action.

* `name`: Name of the action (mandatory).

When clicked, the formspec is send to the server. The value of the text field
sent to `on_player_receive_fields` will be "action:" concatenated to the action
name.

`<img name=... float=... width=... height=...>`

Draws an image which is present in the client media cache.

* `name`: Name of the texture (mandatory).
* `float`: If present, makes the image floating (`left` or `right`).
* `width`: Force image width instead of taking texture width.
* `height`: Force image height instead of taking texture height.

If only width or height given, texture aspect is kept.

`<item name=... float=... width=... height=... rotate=...>`

Draws an item image.

* `name`: Item string of the item to draw (mandatory).
* `float`: If present, makes the image floating (`left` or `right`).
* `width`: Item image width.
* `height`: Item image height.
* `rotate`: Rotate item image if set to `yes` or `X,Y,Z`. X, Y and Z being
rotation speeds in percent of standard speed (-1000 to 1000). Works only if
`inventory_items_animations` is set to true.
* `angle`: Angle in which the item image is shown. Value has `X,Y,Z` form.
X, Y and Z being angles around each three axes. Works only if
`inventory_items_animations` is set to true.

Inventory
=========

Inventory locations
-------------------

* `"context"`: Selected node metadata (deprecated: `"current_name"`)
* `"current_player"`: Player to whom the menu is shown
* `"player:<name>"`: Any player
* `"nodemeta:<X>,<Y>,<Z>"`: Any node metadata
* `"detached:<name>"`: A detached inventory

Player Inventory lists
----------------------

* `main`: list containing the default inventory
* `craft`: list containing the craft input
* `craftpreview`: list containing the craft prediction
* `craftresult`: list containing the crafted output
* `hand`: list containing an override for the empty hand
    * Is not created automatically, use `InvRef:set_size`
    * Is only used to enhance the empty hand's tool capabilities

Colors
======

`ColorString`
-------------

`#RGB` defines a color in hexadecimal format.

`#RGBA` defines a color in hexadecimal format and alpha channel.

`#RRGGBB` defines a color in hexadecimal format.

`#RRGGBBAA` defines a color in hexadecimal format and alpha channel.

Named colors are also supported and are equivalent to
[CSS Color Module Level 4](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/#named-colors).
To specify the value of the alpha channel, append `#AA` to the end of the color
name (e.g. `colorname#08`). For named colors the hexadecimal string
representing the alpha value must (always) be two hexadecimal digits.

`ColorSpec`
-----------

A ColorSpec specifies a 32-bit color. It can be written in any of the following
forms:

* table form: Each element ranging from 0..255 (a, if absent, defaults to 255):
    * `colorspec = {a=255, r=0, g=255, b=0}`
* numerical form: The raw integer value of an ARGB8 quad:
    * `colorspec = 0xFF00FF00`
* string form: A ColorString (defined above):
    * `colorspec = "green"`




Escape sequences
================

Most text can contain escape sequences, that can for example color the text.
There are a few exceptions: tab headers, dropdowns and vertical labels can't.
The following functions provide escape sequences:

* `minetest.get_color_escape_sequence(color)`:
    * `color` is a ColorString
    * The escape sequence sets the text color to `color`
* `minetest.colorize(color, message)`:
    * Equivalent to:
      `minetest.get_color_escape_sequence(color) ..
      message ..
      minetest.get_color_escape_sequence("#ffffff")`
* `minetest.get_background_escape_sequence(color)`
    * `color` is a ColorString
    * The escape sequence sets the background of the whole text element to
      `color`. Only defined for item descriptions and tooltips.
* `minetest.strip_foreground_colors(str)`
    * Removes foreground colors added by `get_color_escape_sequence`.
* `minetest.strip_background_colors(str)`
    * Removes background colors added by `get_background_escape_sequence`.
* `minetest.strip_colors(str)`
    * Removes all color escape sequences.




Spatial Vectors
===============
A spatial vector is similar to a position, but instead using
absolute world coordinates, it uses *relative* coordinates, relative to
no particular point.

Internally, it is implemented as a table with the 3 fields
`x`, `y` and `z`. Example: `{x = 0, y = 1, z = 0}`.

For the following functions, `v`, `v1`, `v2` are vectors,
`p1`, `p2` are positions,
`s` is a scalar (a number):

* `vector.new(a[, b, c])`:
    * Returns a vector.
    * A copy of `a` if `a` is a vector.
    * `{x = a, y = b, z = c}`, if all of `a`, `b`, `c` are defined numbers.
* `vector.direction(p1, p2)`:
    * Returns a vector of length 1 with direction `p1` to `p2`.
    * If `p1` and `p2` are identical, returns `{x = 0, y = 0, z = 0}`.
* `vector.distance(p1, p2)`:
    * Returns zero or a positive number, the distance between `p1` and `p2`.
* `vector.length(v)`:
    * Returns zero or a positive number, the length of vector `v`.
* `vector.normalize(v)`:
    * Returns a vector of length 1 with direction of vector `v`.
    * If `v` has zero length, returns `{x = 0, y = 0, z = 0}`.
* `vector.floor(v)`:
    * Returns a vector, each dimension rounded down.
* `vector.round(v)`:
    * Returns a vector, each dimension rounded to nearest integer.
* `vector.apply(v, func)`:
    * Returns a vector where the function `func` has been applied to each
      component.
* `vector.equals(v1, v2)`:
    * Returns a boolean, `true` if the vectors are identical.
* `vector.sort(v1, v2)`:
    * Returns in order minp, maxp vectors of the cuboid defined by `v1`, `v2`.
* `vector.angle(v1, v2)`:
    * Returns the angle between `v1` and `v2` in radians.
* `vector.dot(v1, v2)`:
    * Returns the dot product of `v1` and `v2`.
* `vector.cross(v1, v2)`:
    * Returns the cross product of `v1` and `v2`.
* `vector.offset(v, x, y, z)`:
    * Returns the sum of the vectors `v` and `{x = x, y = y, z = z}`.

For the following functions `x` can be either a vector or a number:

* `vector.add(v, x)`:
    * Returns a vector.
    * If `x` is a vector: Returns the sum of `v` and `x`.
    * If `x` is a number: Adds `x` to each component of `v`.
* `vector.subtract(v, x)`:
    * Returns a vector.
    * If `x` is a vector: Returns the difference of `v` subtracted by `x`.
    * If `x` is a number: Subtracts `x` from each component of `v`.
* `vector.multiply(v, s)`:
    * Returns a scaled vector.
    * Deprecated: If `s` is a vector: Returns the Schur product.
* `vector.divide(v, s)`:
    * Returns a scaled vector.
    * Deprecated: If `s` is a vector: Returns the Schur quotient.

For the following functions `a` is an angle in radians and `r` is a rotation
vector ({x = <pitch>, y = <yaw>, z = <roll>}) where pitch, yaw and roll are
angles in radians.

* `vector.rotate(v, r)`:
    * Applies the rotation `r` to `v` and returns the result.
    * `vector.rotate({x = 0, y = 0, z = 1}, r)` and
      `vector.rotate({x = 0, y = 1, z = 0}, r)` return vectors pointing
      forward and up relative to an entity's rotation `r`.
* `vector.rotate_around_axis(v1, v2, a)`:
    * Returns `v1` rotated around axis `v2` by `a` radians according to
      the right hand rule.
* `vector.dir_to_rotation(direction[, up])`:
    * Returns a rotation vector for `direction` pointing forward using `up`
      as the up vector.
    * If `up` is omitted, the roll of the returned vector defaults to zero.
    * Otherwise `direction` and `up` need to be vectors in a 90 degree angle to each other.



SSCSM
=====

MultiCraft has a built-in SSCSM implementation that will load SSCSMs onto
MultiCraft clients, as well as non-MultiCraft clients if they have the correct
CSM installed.


Server-side API
---------------

* `sscsm.register(SSCSM definition table)`:
    * Registers a server-provided CSM with an [SSCSM definition table].
* `sscsm.register_on_sscsms_loaded(function(name))`:
    * Registers a callback that will be called when SSCSMs have been loaded
      on a client.
* `sscsm.has_sscsms_enabled(name)`:
    * Returns a boolean.
    * Returns `true` if the client supports SSCSMs and SSCSMs have been loaded.
    * Note that this will not return `true` immediately after joining.
* `sscsm.com_send(player_or_name, channel, msg)`:
    * Sends a com message to a specific client.
    * `msg` can be any object that can be serialized with JSON.
* `sscsm.com_send_all(channel, msg)`:
    * Sends a com message to all clients.
* `sscsm.register_on_com_receive(channel, function(name, msg))`:
    * Registers a function to be called when a message on channel is received
      from the client.
    * Note that `msg` may be any JSON-compatible type, so checking the type of
      this object is strongly recommended.

Client-side API
---------------

SSCSMs have access most of the API functions mentioned in client_lua_api.txt,
along with an extra `sscsm` namespace:

* `sscsm.register_on_mods_loaded(function())`:
    * Runs the provided callback once all SSCSMs are loaded.
* `sscsm.register_chatcommand(command, function(param))`:
    * Similar to `minetest.register_chatcommand`, however overrides commands
      starting in `/` instead. This can be used to make some commands have
      instantaneous responses.
* `sscsm.unregister_chatcommand(command)`:
    * Unregisters a chatcommand.
* `sscsm.get_player_control()`:
    * Returns a table similar to the server-side `player:get_player_control()`.
* `sscsm.every(interval, func, ...)`:
    * Calls `func` every `interval` seconds with any extra parameters specified.
    * Use `minetest.register_globalstep` instead if `interval` is zero.
* `sscsm.com_send(channel, msg)`:
    * Sends `msg` (a JSON-compatible object) to the server.
    * Note that client-to-server messages cannot be long, for plain strings
      the channel and message combined must be at most 492 characters.
* `sscsm.register_on_com_receive(channel, function(msg))`:
    * Registers a function to be called when a message on `channel` is received
      from the server.

This namespace has the following constants:
* `sscsm.restriction_flags`:
    * The `csm_restriction_flags` setting set in the server's `multicraft.conf`.
* `sscsm.restrictions`: A table based on `csm_restriction_flags`:
    * `chat_messages`: When `true`, SSCSMs can't send chat messages or run
       server chatcommands.
    * `read_itemdefs`: When `true`, SSCSMs can't read item definitions.
    * `read_nodedefs`: When `true`, SSCSMs can't read node definitions.
    * `lookup_nodes_limit`: When `true`, any get_node calls are restricted.
    * `read_playerinfo`: When `true`, `minetest.get_player_names()` will return
      `nil`.


SSCSM definition table
----------------------

```lua
sscsm.register({
    -- The name of the server-provided CSM. Using `modname` or
    -- `modname:sscsmname` is strongly recommended. This name cannot start with
    -- a colon or contain newlines.
    name = "mymod",

    -- The code to be sent to clients.
    -- code = "print('Hello world!')",

    -- The file to read code from.
    -- This should be used instead of `code`.
    file = minetest.get_modpath("mymod") .. DIR_DELIM .. "sscsm.lua",

    -- An optional list of SSCSMs that this one depends on.
    -- depends = {"othermod"},
})
```

Security considerations
-----------------------

Do not trust any input sent to the server via SSCSMs (and do not store
sensitive data in SSCSM code), as malicious users can and will inspect code and
modify the output from SSCSMs.

I repeat, **do not trust the client** and/or SSCSMs with any sensitive
information and do not trust any output from the client and/or SSCSMs. Make
sure you rerun any privilege checks on the server.

* `table.indexof(list, val)`: returns the smallest numerical index containing
      the value `val` in the table `list`. Non-numerical indices are ignored.
      If `val` could not be found, `-1` is returned. `list` must not have
      negative indices.
* `table.insert_all(table, other_table)`:
    * Appends all values in `other_table` to `table` - uses `#table + 1` to
      find new indices.
* `table.key_value_swap(t)`: returns a table with keys and values swapped
    * If multiple keys in `t` map to the same value, it is unspecified which
      value maps to that key.
* `table.shuffle(table, [from], [to], [random_func])`:
    * Shuffles elements `from` to `to` in `table` in place
    * `from` defaults to `1`
    * `to` defaults to `#table`
    * `random_func` defaults to `math.random`. This function receives two
      integers as arguments and should return a random integer inclusively
      between them.
* `minetest.pointed_thing_to_face_pos(placer, pointed_thing)`: returns a
  position.
    * returns the exact position on the surface of a pointed node
* `minetest.get_dig_params(groups, tool_capabilities)`: Simulates a tool
    that digs a node.
    Returns a table with the following fields:
    * `diggable`: `true` if node can be dug, `false` otherwise.
    * `time`: Time it would take to dig the node.
    * `wear`: How much wear would be added to the tool.
    `time` and `wear` are meaningless if node's not diggable
    Parameters:
    * `groups`: Table of the node groups of the node that would be dug
    * `tool_capabilities`: Tool capabilities table of the tool
* `minetest.get_hit_params(groups, tool_capabilities [, time_from_last_punch])`:
    Simulates an item that punches an object.
    Returns a table with the following fields:
    * `hp`: How much damage the punch would cause.
    * `wear`: How much wear would be added to the tool.
    Parameters:
    * `groups`: Damage groups of the object
    * `tool_capabilities`: Tool capabilities table of the item
    * `time_from_last_punch`: time in seconds since last punch action




Translations
============

Texts can be translated client-side with the help of `minetest.translate` and
translation files.

Translating a string
--------------------

Two functions are provided to translate strings: `minetest.translate` and
`minetest.get_translator`.

* `minetest.get_translator(textdomain)` is a simple wrapper around
  `minetest.translate`, and `minetest.get_translator(textdomain)(str, ...)` is
  equivalent to `minetest.translate(textdomain, str, ...)`.
  It is intended to be used in the following way, so that it avoids verbose
  repetitions of `minetest.translate`:

      local S = minetest.get_translator(textdomain)
      S(str, ...)

  As an extra commodity, if `textdomain` is nil, it is assumed to be "" instead.

* `minetest.translate(textdomain, str, ...)` translates the string `str` with
  the given `textdomain` for disambiguation. The textdomain must match the
  textdomain specified in the translation file in order to get the string
  translated. This can be used so that a string is translated differently in
  different contexts.
  It is advised to use the name of the mod as textdomain whenever possible, to
  avoid clashes with other mods.
  This function must be given a number of arguments equal to the number of
  arguments the translated string expects.
  Arguments are literal strings -- they will not be translated, so if you want
  them to be, they need to come as outputs of `minetest.translate` as well.

  For instance, suppose we want to translate "@1 Wool" with "@1" being replaced
  by the translation of "Red". We can do the following:

      local S = minetest.get_translator()
      S("@1 Wool", S("Red"))

  This will be displayed as "Red Wool" on old clients and on clients that do
  not have localization enabled. However, if we have for instance a translation
  file named `wool.fr.tr` containing the following:

      @1 Wool=Laine @1
      Red=Rouge

  this will be displayed as "Laine Rouge" on clients with a French locale.

Operations on translated strings
--------------------------------

The output of `minetest.translate` is a string, with escape sequences adding
additional information to that string so that it can be translated on the
different clients. In particular, you can't expect operations like string.length
to work on them like you would expect them to, or string.gsub to work in the
expected manner. However, string concatenation will still work as expected
(note that you should only use this for things like formspecs; do not translate
sentences by breaking them into parts; arguments should be used instead), and
operations such as `minetest.colorize` which are also concatenation.

Translation file format
-----------------------

A translation file has the suffix `.[lang].tr`, where `[lang]` is the language
it corresponds to. It must be put into the `locale` subdirectory of the mod.
The file should be a text file, with the following format:

* Lines beginning with `# textdomain:` (the space is significant) can be used
  to specify the text domain of all following translations in the file.
* All other empty lines or lines beginning with `#` are ignored.
* Other lines should be in the format `original=translated`. Both `original`
  and `translated` can contain escape sequences beginning with `@` to insert
  arguments, literal `@`, `=` or newline (See [Escapes] below).
  There must be no extraneous whitespace around the `=` or at the beginning or
  the end of the line.

Escapes
-------

Strings that need to be translated can contain several escapes, preceded by `@`.

* `@@` acts as a literal `@`.
* `@n`, where `n` is a digit between 1 and 9, is an argument for the translated
  string that will be inlined when translated. Due to how translations are
  implemented, the original translation string **must** have its arguments in
  increasing order, without gaps or repetitions, starting from 1.
* `@=` acts as a literal `=`. It is not required in strings given to
  `minetest.translate`, but is in translation files to avoid being confused
  with the `=` separating the original from the translation.
* `@\n` (where the `\n` is a literal newline) acts as a literal newline.
  As with `@=`, this escape is not required in strings given to
  `minetest.translate`, but is in translation files.
* `@n` acts as a literal newline as well.

Server side translations
------------------------

On some specific cases, server translation could be useful. For example, filter
a list on labels and send results to client. A method is supplied to achieve
that:

`minetest.get_translated_string(lang_code, string)`: Translates `string` using
translations for `lang_code` language. It gives the same result as if the string
was translated by the client.

The `lang_code` to use for a given player can be retrieved from
the table returned by `minetest.get_player_information(name)`.

IMPORTANT: This functionality should only be used for sorting, filtering or similar purposes.
You do not need to use this to get translated strings to show up on the client.

Perlin noise
============

Perlin noise creates a continuously-varying value depending on the input values.
Usually in Minetest the input values are either 2D or 3D co-ordinates in nodes.
The result is used during map generation to create the terrain shape, vary heat
and humidity to distribute biomes, vary the density of decorations or vary the
structure of ores.

Structure of perlin noise
-------------------------

An 'octave' is a simple noise generator that outputs a value between -1 and 1.
The smooth wavy noise it generates has a single characteristic scale, almost
like a 'wavelength', so on its own does not create fine detail.
Due to this perlin noise combines several octaves to create variation on
multiple scales. Each additional octave has a smaller 'wavelength' than the
previous.

This combination results in noise varying very roughly between -2.0 and 2.0 and
with an average value of 0.0, so `scale` and `offset` are then used to multiply
and offset the noise variation.

The final perlin noise variation is created as follows:

noise = offset + scale * (octave1 +
                          octave2 * persistence +
                          octave3 * persistence ^ 2 +
                          octave4 * persistence ^ 3 +
                          ...)

Noise Parameters
----------------

Noise Parameters are commonly called `NoiseParams`.

### `offset`

After the multiplication by `scale` this is added to the result and is the final
step in creating the noise value.
Can be positive or negative.

### `scale`

Once all octaves have been combined, the result is multiplied by this.
Can be positive or negative.

### `spread`

For octave1, this is roughly the change of input value needed for a very large
variation in the noise value generated by octave1. It is almost like a
'wavelength' for the wavy noise variation.
Each additional octave has a 'wavelength' that is smaller than the previous
octave, to create finer detail. `spread` will therefore roughly be the typical
size of the largest structures in the final noise variation.

`spread` is a vector with values for x, y, z to allow the noise variation to be
stretched or compressed in the desired axes.
Values are positive numbers.

### `seed`

This is a whole number that determines the entire pattern of the noise
variation. Altering it enables different noise patterns to be created.
With other parameters equal, different seeds produce different noise patterns
and identical seeds produce identical noise patterns.

For this parameter you can randomly choose any whole number. Usually it is
preferable for this to be different from other seeds, but sometimes it is useful
to be able to create identical noise patterns.

In some noise APIs the world seed is added to the seed specified in noise
parameters. This is done to make the resulting noise pattern vary in different
worlds, and be 'world-specific'.

### `octaves`

The number of simple noise generators that are combined.
A whole number, 1 or more.
Each additional octave adds finer detail to the noise but also increases the
noise calculation load.
3 is a typical minimum for a high quality, complex and natural-looking noise
variation. 1 octave has a slight 'gridlike' appearence.

Choose the number of octaves according to the `spread` and `lacunarity`, and the
size of the finest detail you require. For example:
if `spread` is 512 nodes, `lacunarity` is 2.0 and finest detail required is 16
nodes, octaves will be 6 because the 'wavelengths' of the octaves will be
512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16 nodes.
Warning: If the 'wavelength' of any octave falls below 1 an error will occur.

### `persistence`

Each additional octave has an amplitude that is the amplitude of the previous
octave multiplied by `persistence`, to reduce the amplitude of finer details,
as is often helpful and natural to do so.
Since this controls the balance of fine detail to large-scale detail
`persistence` can be thought of as the 'roughness' of the noise.

A positive or negative non-zero number, often between 0.3 and 1.0.
A common medium value is 0.5, such that each octave has half the amplitude of
the previous octave.
This may need to be tuned when altering `lacunarity`; when doing so consider
that a common medium value is 1 / lacunarity.

### `lacunarity`

Each additional octave has a 'wavelength' that is the 'wavelength' of the
previous octave multiplied by 1 / lacunarity, to create finer detail.
'lacunarity' is often 2.0 so 'wavelength' often halves per octave.

A positive number no smaller than 1.0.
Values below 2.0 create higher quality noise at the expense of requiring more
octaves to cover a paticular range of 'wavelengths'.

### `flags`

Leave this field unset for no special handling.
Currently supported are `defaults`, `eased` and `absvalue`:

#### `defaults`

Specify this if you would like to keep auto-selection of eased/not-eased while
specifying some other flags.

#### `eased`

Maps noise gradient values onto a quintic S-curve before performing
interpolation. This results in smooth, rolling noise.
Disable this (`noeased`) for sharp-looking noise with a slightly gridded
appearence.
If no flags are specified (or defaults is), 2D noise is eased and 3D noise is
not eased.
Easing a 3D noise significantly increases the noise calculation load, so use
with restraint.

#### `absvalue`

The absolute value of each octave's noise variation is used when combining the
octaves. The final perlin noise variation is created as follows:

noise = offset + scale * (abs(octave1) +
                          abs(octave2) * persistence +
                          abs(octave3) * persistence ^ 2 +
                          abs(octave4) * persistence ^ 3 +
                          ...)

### Format example

For 2D or 3D perlin noise or perlin noise maps:

    np_terrain = {
        offset = 0,
        scale = 1,
        spread = {x = 500, y = 500, z = 500},
        seed = 571347,
        octaves = 5,
        persist = 0.63,
        lacunarity = 2.0,
        flags = "defaults, absvalue",
    }

For 2D noise the Z component of `spread` is still defined but is ignored.
A single noise parameter table can be used for 2D or 3D noise.




Ores
====

Ore types
---------

These tell in what manner the ore is generated.

All default ores are of the uniformly-distributed scatter type.

### `scatter`

Randomly chooses a location and generates a cluster of ore.

If `noise_params` is specified, the ore will be placed if the 3D perlin noise
at that point is greater than the `noise_threshold`, giving the ability to
create a non-equal distribution of ore.

### `sheet`

Creates a sheet of ore in a blob shape according to the 2D perlin noise
described by `noise_params` and `noise_threshold`. This is essentially an
improved version of the so-called "stratus" ore seen in some unofficial mods.

This sheet consists of vertical columns of uniform randomly distributed height,
varying between the inclusive range `column_height_min` and `column_height_max`.
If `column_height_min` is not specified, this parameter defaults to 1.
If `column_height_max` is not specified, this parameter defaults to `clust_size`
for reverse compatibility. New code should prefer `column_height_max`.

The `column_midpoint_factor` parameter controls the position of the column at
which ore emanates from.
If 1, columns grow upward. If 0, columns grow downward. If 0.5, columns grow
equally starting from each direction.
`column_midpoint_factor` is a decimal number ranging in value from 0 to 1. If
this parameter is not specified, the default is 0.5.

The ore parameters `clust_scarcity` and `clust_num_ores` are ignored for this
ore type.

### `puff`

Creates a sheet of ore in a cloud-like puff shape.

As with the `sheet` ore type, the size and shape of puffs are described by
`noise_params` and `noise_threshold` and are placed at random vertical
positions within the currently generated chunk.

The vertical top and bottom displacement of each puff are determined by the
noise parameters `np_puff_top` and `np_puff_bottom`, respectively.

### `blob`

Creates a deformed sphere of ore according to 3d perlin noise described by
`noise_params`. The maximum size of the blob is `clust_size`, and
`clust_scarcity` has the same meaning as with the `scatter` type.

### `vein`

Creates veins of ore varying in density by according to the intersection of two
instances of 3d perlin noise with different seeds, both described by
`noise_params`.

`random_factor` varies the influence random chance has on placement of an ore
inside the vein, which is `1` by default. Note that modifying this parameter
may require adjusting `noise_threshold`.

The parameters `clust_scarcity`, `clust_num_ores`, and `clust_size` are ignored
by this ore type.

This ore type is difficult to control since it is sensitive to small changes.
The following is a decent set of parameters to work from:

    noise_params = {
        offset  = 0,
        scale   = 3,
        spread  = {x=200, y=200, z=200},
        seed    = 5390,
        octaves = 4,
        persist = 0.5,
        lacunarity = 2.0,
        flags = "eased",
    },
    noise_threshold = 1.6

**WARNING**: Use this ore type *very* sparingly since it is ~200x more
computationally expensive than any other ore.

### `stratum`

Creates a single undulating ore stratum that is continuous across mapchunk
borders and horizontally spans the world.

The 2D perlin noise described by `noise_params` defines the Y co-ordinate of
the stratum midpoint. The 2D perlin noise described by `np_stratum_thickness`
defines the stratum's vertical thickness (in units of nodes). Due to being
continuous across mapchunk borders the stratum's vertical thickness is
unlimited.

If the noise parameter `noise_params` is omitted the ore will occur from y_min
to y_max in a simple horizontal stratum.

A parameter `stratum_thickness` can be provided instead of the noise parameter
`np_stratum_thickness`, to create a constant thickness.

Leaving out one or both noise parameters makes the ore generation less
intensive, useful when adding multiple strata.

`y_min` and `y_max` define the limits of the ore generation and for performance
reasons should be set as close together as possible but without clipping the
stratum's Y variation.

Each node in the stratum has a 1-in-`clust_scarcity` chance of being ore, so a
solid-ore stratum would require a `clust_scarcity` of 1.

The parameters `clust_num_ores`, `clust_size`, `noise_threshold` and
`random_factor` are ignored by this ore type.

Ore attributes
--------------

See section [Flag Specifier Format].

Currently supported flags:
`puff_cliffs`, `puff_additive_composition`.

### `puff_cliffs`

If set, puff ore generation will not taper down large differences in
displacement when approaching the edge of a puff. This flag has no effect for
ore types other than `puff`.

### `puff_additive_composition`

By default, when noise described by `np_puff_top` or `np_puff_bottom` results
in a negative displacement, the sub-column at that point is not generated. With
this attribute set, puff ore generation will instead generate the absolute
difference in noise displacement values. This flag has no effect for ore types
other than `puff`.




Decoration types
================

The varying types of decorations that can be placed.

`simple`
--------

Creates a 1 times `H` times 1 column of a specified node (or a random node from
a list, if a decoration list is specified). Can specify a certain node it must
spawn next to, such as water or lava, for example. Can also generate a
decoration of random height between a specified lower and upper bound.
This type of decoration is intended for placement of grass, flowers, cacti,
papyri, waterlilies and so on.

`schematic`
-----------

Copies a box of `MapNodes` from a specified schematic file (or raw description).
Can specify a probability of a node randomly appearing when placed.
This decoration type is intended to be used for multi-node sized discrete
structures, such as trees, cave spikes, rocks, and so on.




Schematics
==========

Schematic specifier
--------------------

A schematic specifier identifies a schematic by either a filename to a
Minetest Schematic file (`.mts`) or through raw data supplied through Lua,
in the form of a table.  This table specifies the following fields:

* The `size` field is a 3D vector containing the dimensions of the provided
  schematic. (required field)
* The `yslice_prob` field is a table of {ypos, prob} slice tables. A slice table
  sets the probability of a particular horizontal slice of the schematic being
  placed. (optional field)
  `ypos` = 0 for the lowest horizontal slice of a schematic.
  The default of `prob` is 255.
* The `data` field is a flat table of MapNode tables making up the schematic,
  in the order of `[z [y [x]]]`. (required field)
  Each MapNode table contains:
    * `name`: the name of the map node to place (required)
    * `prob` (alias `param1`): the probability of this node being placed
      (default: 255)
    * `param2`: the raw param2 value of the node being placed onto the map
      (default: 0)
    * `force_place`: boolean representing if the node should forcibly overwrite
      any previous contents (default: false)

About probability values:

* A probability value of `0` or `1` means that node will never appear
  (0% chance).
* A probability value of `254` or `255` means the node will always appear
  (100% chance).
* If the probability value `p` is greater than `1`, then there is a
  `(p / 256 * 100)` percent chance that node will appear when the schematic is
  placed on the map.

Schematic attributes
--------------------

See section [Flag Specifier Format].

Currently supported flags: `place_center_x`, `place_center_y`, `place_center_z`,
                           `force_placement`.

* `place_center_x`: Placement of this decoration is centered along the X axis.
* `place_center_y`: Placement of this decoration is centered along the Y axis.
* `place_center_z`: Placement of this decoration is centered along the Z axis.
* `force_placement`: Schematic nodes other than "ignore" will replace existing
  nodes.




Lua Voxel Manipulator
=====================

About VoxelManip
----------------

VoxelManip is a scripting interface to the internal 'Map Voxel Manipulator'
facility. The purpose of this object is for fast, low-level, bulk access to
reading and writing Map content. As such, setting map nodes through VoxelManip
will lack many of the higher level features and concepts you may be used to
with other methods of setting nodes. For example, nodes will not have their
construction and destruction callbacks run, and no rollback information is
logged.

It is important to note that VoxelManip is designed for speed, and *not* ease
of use or flexibility. If your mod requires a map manipulation facility that
will handle 100% of all edge cases, or the use of high level node placement
features, perhaps `minetest.set_node()` is better suited for the job.

In addition, VoxelManip might not be faster, or could even be slower, for your
specific use case. VoxelManip is most effective when setting large areas of map
at once - for example, if only setting a 3x3x3 node area, a
`minetest.set_node()` loop may be more optimal. Always profile code using both
methods of map manipulation to determine which is most appropriate for your
usage.

A recent simple test of setting cubic areas showed that `minetest.set_node()`
is faster than a VoxelManip for a 3x3x3 node cube or smaller.

Using VoxelManip
----------------

A VoxelManip object can be created any time using either:
`VoxelManip([p1, p2])`, or `minetest.get_voxel_manip([p1, p2])`.

If the optional position parameters are present for either of these routines,
the specified region will be pre-loaded into the VoxelManip object on creation.
Otherwise, the area of map you wish to manipulate must first be loaded into the
VoxelManip object using `VoxelManip:read_from_map()`.

Note that `VoxelManip:read_from_map()` returns two position vectors. The region
formed by these positions indicate the minimum and maximum (respectively)
positions of the area actually loaded in the VoxelManip, which may be larger
than the area requested. For convenience, the loaded area coordinates can also
be queried any time after loading map data with `VoxelManip:get_emerged_area()`.

Now that the VoxelManip object is populated with map data, your mod can fetch a
copy of this data using either of two methods. `VoxelManip:get_node_at()`,
which retrieves an individual node in a MapNode formatted table at the position
requested is the simplest method to use, but also the slowest.

Nodes in a VoxelManip object may also be read in bulk to a flat array table
using:

* `VoxelManip:get_data()` for node content (in Content ID form, see section
  [Content IDs]),
* `VoxelManip:get_light_data()` for node light levels, and
* `VoxelManip:get_param2_data()` for the node type-dependent "param2" values.

See section [Flat array format] for more details.

It is very important to understand that the tables returned by any of the above
three functions represent a snapshot of the VoxelManip's internal state at the
time of the call. This copy of the data will not magically update itself if
another function modifies the internal VoxelManip state.
Any functions that modify a VoxelManip's contents work on the VoxelManip's
internal state unless otherwise explicitly stated.

Once the bulk data has been edited to your liking, the internal VoxelManip
state can be set using:

* `VoxelManip:set_data()` for node content (in Content ID form, see section
  [Content IDs]),
* `VoxelManip:set_light_data()` for node light levels, and
* `VoxelManip:set_param2_data()` for the node type-dependent `param2` values.

The parameter to each of the above three functions can use any table at all in
the same flat array format as produced by `get_data()` etc. and is not required
to be a table retrieved from `get_data()`.

Once the internal VoxelManip state has been modified to your liking, the
changes can be committed back to the map by calling `VoxelManip:write_to_map()`

### Flat array format

Let
    `Nx = p2.X - p1.X + 1`,
    `Ny = p2.Y - p1.Y + 1`, and
    `Nz = p2.Z - p1.Z + 1`.

Then, for a loaded region of p1..p2, this array ranges from `1` up to and
including the value of the expression `Nx * Ny * Nz`.

Positions offset from p1 are present in the array with the format of:

    [
        (0, 0, 0),   (1, 0, 0),   (2, 0, 0),   ... (Nx, 0, 0),
        (0, 1, 0),   (1, 1, 0),   (2, 1, 0),   ... (Nx, 1, 0),
        ...
        (0, Ny, 0),  (1, Ny, 0),  (2, Ny, 0),  ... (Nx, Ny, 0),
        (0, 0, 1),   (1, 0, 1),   (2, 0, 1),   ... (Nx, 0, 1),
        ...
        (0, Ny, 2),  (1, Ny, 2),  (2, Ny, 2),  ... (Nx, Ny, 2),
        ...
        (0, Ny, Nz), (1, Ny, Nz), (2, Ny, Nz), ... (Nx, Ny, Nz)
    ]

and the array index for a position p contained completely in p1..p2 is:

`(p.Z - p1.Z) * Ny * Nx + (p.Y - p1.Y) * Nx + (p.X - p1.X) + 1`

Note that this is the same "flat 3D array" format as
`PerlinNoiseMap:get3dMap_flat()`.
VoxelArea objects (see section [`VoxelArea`]) can be used to simplify calculation
of the index for a single point in a flat VoxelManip array.

### Content IDs

A Content ID is a unique integer identifier for a specific node type.
These IDs are used by VoxelManip in place of the node name string for
`VoxelManip:get_data()` and `VoxelManip:set_data()`. You can use
`minetest.get_content_id()` to look up the Content ID for the specified node
name, and `minetest.get_name_from_content_id()` to look up the node name string
for a given Content ID.
After registration of a node, its Content ID will remain the same throughout
execution of the mod.
Note that the node being queried needs to have already been been registered.

The following builtin node types have their Content IDs defined as constants:

* `minetest.CONTENT_UNKNOWN`: ID for "unknown" nodes
* `minetest.CONTENT_AIR`:     ID for "air" nodes
* `minetest.CONTENT_IGNORE`:  ID for "ignore" nodes

### Mapgen VoxelManip objects

Inside of `on_generated()` callbacks, it is possible to retrieve the same
VoxelManip object used by the core's Map Generator (commonly abbreviated
Mapgen). Most of the rules previously described still apply but with a few
differences:

* The Mapgen VoxelManip object is retrieved using:
  `minetest.get_mapgen_object("voxelmanip")`
* This VoxelManip object already has the region of map just generated loaded
  into it; it's not necessary to call `VoxelManip:read_from_map()` before using
  a Mapgen VoxelManip.
* The `on_generated()` callbacks of some mods may place individual nodes in the
  generated area using non-VoxelManip map modification methods. Because the
  same Mapgen VoxelManip object is passed through each `on_generated()`
  callback, it becomes necessary for the Mapgen VoxelManip object to maintain
  consistency with the current map state. For this reason, calling any of the
  following functions:
  `minetest.add_node()`, `minetest.set_node()`, or `minetest.swap_node()`
  will also update the Mapgen VoxelManip object's internal state active on the
  current thread.
* After modifying the Mapgen VoxelManip object's internal buffer, it may be
  necessary to update lighting information using either:
  `VoxelManip:calc_lighting()` or `VoxelManip:set_lighting()`.

### Other API functions operating on a VoxelManip

If any VoxelManip contents were set to a liquid node,
`VoxelManip:update_liquids()` must be called for these liquid nodes to begin
flowing. It is recommended to call this function only after having written all
buffered data back to the VoxelManip object, save for special situations where
the modder desires to only have certain liquid nodes begin flowing.

The functions `minetest.generate_ores()` and `minetest.generate_decorations()`
will generate all registered decorations and ores throughout the full area
inside of the specified VoxelManip object.

`minetest.place_schematic_on_vmanip()` is otherwise identical to
`minetest.place_schematic()`, except instead of placing the specified schematic
directly on the map at the specified position, it will place the schematic
inside the VoxelManip.

### Notes

* Attempting to read data from a VoxelManip object before map is read will
  result in a zero-length array table for `VoxelManip:get_data()`, and an
  "ignore" node at any position for `VoxelManip:get_node_at()`.
* If either a region of map has not yet been generated or is out-of-bounds of
  the map, that region is filled with "ignore" nodes.
* Other mods, or the core itself, could possibly modify the area of map
  currently loaded into a VoxelManip object. With the exception of Mapgen
  VoxelManips (see above section), the internal buffers are not updated. For
  this reason, it is strongly encouraged to complete the usage of a particular
  VoxelManip object in the same callback it had been created.
* If a VoxelManip object will be used often, such as in an `on_generated()`
  callback, consider passing a file-scoped table as the optional parameter to
  `VoxelManip:get_data()`, which serves as a static buffer the function can use
  to write map data to instead of returning a new table each call. This greatly
  enhances performance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations.

Methods
-------

* `read_from_map(p1, p2)`:  Loads a chunk of map into the VoxelManip object
  containing the region formed by `p1` and `p2`.
    * returns actual emerged `pmin`, actual emerged `pmax`
* `write_to_map([light])`: Writes the data loaded from the `VoxelManip` back to
  the map.
    * **important**: data must be set using `VoxelManip:set_data()` before
      calling this.
    * if `light` is true, then lighting is automatically recalculated.
      The default value is true.
      If `light` is false, no light calculations happen, and you should correct
      all modified blocks with `minetest.fix_light()` as soon as possible.
      Keep in mind that modifying the map where light is incorrect can cause
      more lighting bugs.
* `get_node_at(pos)`: Returns a `MapNode` table of the node currently loaded in
  the `VoxelManip` at that position
* `set_node_at(pos, node)`: Sets a specific `MapNode` in the `VoxelManip` at
  that position.
* `get_data([buffer])`: Retrieves the node content data loaded into the
  `VoxelManip` object.
    * returns raw node data in the form of an array of node content IDs
    * if the param `buffer` is present, this table will be used to store the
      result instead.
* `set_data(data)`: Sets the data contents of the `VoxelManip` object
* `update_map()`: Does nothing, kept for compatibility.
* `set_lighting(light, [p1, p2])`: Set the lighting within the `VoxelManip` to
  a uniform value.
    * `light` is a table, `{day=<0...15>, night=<0...15>}`
    * To be used only by a `VoxelManip` object from
      `minetest.get_mapgen_object`.
    * (`p1`, `p2`) is the area in which lighting is set, defaults to the whole
      area if left out.
* `get_light_data()`: Gets the light data read into the `VoxelManip` object
    * Returns an array (indices 1 to volume) of integers ranging from `0` to
      `255`.
    * Each value is the bitwise combination of day and night light values
      (`0` to `15` each).
    * `light = day + (night * 16)`
* `set_light_data(light_data)`: Sets the `param1` (light) contents of each node
  in the `VoxelManip`.
    * expects lighting data in the same format that `get_light_data()` returns
* `get_param2_data([buffer])`: Gets the raw `param2` data read into the
  `VoxelManip` object.
    * Returns an array (indices 1 to volume) of integers ranging from `0` to
      `255`.
    * If the param `buffer` is present, this table will be used to store the
      result instead.
* `set_param2_data(param2_data)`: Sets the `param2` contents of each node in
  the `VoxelManip`.
* `calc_lighting([p1, p2], [propagate_shadow])`:  Calculate lighting within the
  `VoxelManip`.
    * To be used only by a `VoxelManip` object from
      `minetest.get_mapgen_object`.
    * (`p1`, `p2`) is the area in which lighting is set, defaults to the whole
      area if left out or nil. For almost all uses these should be left out
      or nil to use the default.
    * `propagate_shadow` is an optional boolean deciding whether shadows in a
      generated mapchunk above are propagated down into the mapchunk, defaults
      to `true` if left out.
* `update_liquids()`: Update liquid flow
* `was_modified()`: Returns `true` or `false` if the data in the voxel
  manipulator had been modified since the last read from map, due to a call to
  `minetest.set_data()` on the loaded area elsewhere.
* `get_emerged_area()`: Returns actual emerged minimum and maximum positions.

`VoxelArea`
-----------

A helper class for voxel areas.
It can be created via `VoxelArea:new{MinEdge = pmin, MaxEdge = pmax}`.
The coordinates are *inclusive*, like most other things in Minetest.

### Methods

* `getExtent()`: returns a 3D vector containing the size of the area formed by
  `MinEdge` and `MaxEdge`.
* `getVolume()`: returns the volume of the area formed by `MinEdge` and
  `MaxEdge`.
* `index(x, y, z)`: returns the index of an absolute position in a flat array
  starting at `1`.
    * `x`, `y` and `z` must be integers to avoid an incorrect index result.
    * The position (x, y, z) is not checked for being inside the area volume,
      being outside can cause an incorrect index result.
    * Useful for things like `VoxelManip`, raw Schematic specifiers,
      `PerlinNoiseMap:get2d`/`3dMap`, and so on.
* `indexp(p)`: same functionality as `index(x, y, z)` but takes a vector.
    * As with `index(x, y, z)`, the components of `p` must be integers, and `p`
      is not checked for being inside the area volume.
* `position(i)`: returns the absolute position vector corresponding to index
  `i`.
* `contains(x, y, z)`: check if (`x`,`y`,`z`) is inside area formed by
  `MinEdge` and `MaxEdge`.
* `containsp(p)`: same as above, except takes a vector
* `containsi(i)`: same as above, except takes an index `i`
* `iter(minx, miny, minz, maxx, maxy, maxz)`: returns an iterator that returns
  indices.
    * from (`minx`,`miny`,`minz`) to (`maxx`,`maxy`,`maxz`) in the order of
      `[z [y [x]]]`.
* `iterp(minp, maxp)`: same as above, except takes a vector

### Y stride and z stride of a flat array

For a particular position in a voxel area, whose flat array index is known,
it is often useful to know the index of a neighboring or nearby position.
The table below shows the changes of index required for 1 node movements along
the axes in a voxel area:

    Movement    Change of index
    +x          +1
    -x          -1
    +y          +ystride
    -y          -ystride
    +z          +zstride
    -z          -zstride

If, for example:

    local area = VoxelArea:new{MinEdge = emin, MaxEdge = emax}

The values of `ystride` and `zstride` can be obtained using `area.ystride` and
`area.zstride`.




Mapgen objects
==============

A mapgen object is a construct used in map generation. Mapgen objects can be
used by an `on_generate` callback to speed up operations by avoiding
unnecessary recalculations, these can be retrieved using the
`minetest.get_mapgen_object()` function. If the requested Mapgen object is
unavailable, or `get_mapgen_object()` was called outside of an `on_generate()`
callback, `nil` is returned.

The following Mapgen objects are currently available:

### `voxelmanip`

This returns three values; the `VoxelManip` object to be used, minimum and
maximum emerged position, in that order. All mapgens support this object.

### `heightmap`

Returns an array containing the y coordinates of the ground levels of nodes in
the most recently generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `biomemap`

Returns an array containing the biome IDs of nodes in the most recently
generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `heatmap`

Returns an array containing the temperature values of nodes in the most
recently generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `humiditymap`

Returns an array containing the humidity values of nodes in the most recently
generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `gennotify`

Returns a table mapping requested generation notification types to arrays of
positions at which the corresponding generated structures are located within
the current chunk. To set the capture of positions of interest to be recorded
on generate, use `minetest.set_gen_notify()`.
For decorations, the returned positions are the ground surface 'place_on'
nodes, not the decorations themselves. A 'simple' type decoration is often 1
node above the returned position and possibly displaced by 'place_offset_y'.

Possible fields of the table returned are:

* `dungeon`
* `temple`
* `cave_begin`
* `cave_end`
* `large_cave_begin`
* `large_cave_end`
* `decoration`

Decorations have a key in the format of `"decoration#id"`, where `id` is the
numeric unique decoration ID as returned by `minetest.get_decoration_id`.




Registered entities
===================

Functions receive a "luaentity" as `self`:

* It has the member `.name`, which is the registered name `("mod:thing")`
* It has the member `.object`, which is an `ObjectRef` pointing to the object
* The original prototype stuff is visible directly via a metatable

Callbacks:

* `on_activate(self, staticdata, dtime_s)`
    * Called when the object is instantiated.
    * `dtime_s` is the time passed since the object was unloaded, which can be
      used for updating the entity state.
* `on_deactivate(self)
    * Called when the object is about to get removed or unloaded.
* `on_step(self, dtime)`
    * Called on every server tick, after movement and collision processing.
      `dtime` is usually 0.1 seconds, as per the `dedicated_server_step` setting
      in `multicraft.conf`.
* `on_punch(self, puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, dir, damage)`
    * Called when somebody punches the object.
    * Note that you probably want to handle most punches using the automatic
      armor group system.
    * `puncher`: an `ObjectRef` (can be `nil`)
    * `time_from_last_punch`: Meant for disallowing spamming of clicks
      (can be `nil`).
    * `tool_capabilities`: capability table of used tool (can be `nil`)
    * `dir`: unit vector of direction of punch. Always defined. Points from the
      puncher to the punched.
    * `damage`: damage that will be done to entity.
    * Can return `true` to prevent the default damage mechanism.
* `on_death(self, killer)`
    * Called when the object dies.
    * `killer`: an `ObjectRef` (can be `nil`)
* `on_rightclick(self, clicker)`
* `on_attach_child(self, child)`
    * `child`: an `ObjectRef` of the child that attaches
* `on_detach_child(self, child)`
    * `child`: an `ObjectRef` of the child that detaches
* `on_detach(self, parent)`
    * `parent`: an `ObjectRef` (can be `nil`) from where it got detached
    * This happens before the parent object is removed from the world
* `get_staticdata(self)`
    * Should return a string that will be passed to `on_activate` when the
      object is instantiated the next time.

* `minetest.mkdir(path)`: returns success.
    * Creates a directory specified by `path`, creating parent directories
      if they don't exist.
* `minetest.get_dir_list(path, [is_dir])`: returns list of entry names

    * `is_dev`: Boolean value indicating whether it's a development build
  Use this for informational purposes only. The information in the returned
  table does not represent the capabilities of the engine, nor is it
  reliable or verifiable. Compatible forks will have a different name and
  version entirely. To check for the presence of engine features, test
  whether the functions exported by the wanted features exist. For example:
  `if minetest.check_for_falling then ... end`.
* `minetest.sha1(data, [raw])`: returns the sha1 hash of data
    * `data`: string of data to hash

* `minetest.override_item(name, redefinition)`
    * Overrides fields of an item registered with register_node/tool/craftitem.
    * Note: Item must already be defined, (opt)depend on the mod defining it.
    * Example: `minetest.override_item("default:mese",
      {light_source=minetest.LIGHT_MAX})`
* `minetest.unregister_item(name)`
    * Unregisters the item from the engine, and deletes the entry with key
      `name` from `minetest.registered_items` and from the associated item table
      according to its nature: `minetest.registered_nodes`, etc.
* `minetest.register_entity(name, entity definition)`
* `minetest.register_abm(abm definition)`
* `minetest.register_lbm(lbm definition)`
* `minetest.register_alias(alias, original_name)`
    * Also use this to set the 'mapgen aliases' needed in a game for the core
      mapgens. See [Mapgen aliases] section above.
* `minetest.register_alias_force(alias, original_name)`
* `minetest.register_ore(ore definition)`
    * Returns an integer object handle uniquely identifying the registered
      ore on success.
    * The order of ore registrations determines the order of ore generation.
* `minetest.register_biome(biome definition)`
    * Returns an integer object handle uniquely identifying the registered
      biome on success. To get the biome ID, use `minetest.get_biome_id`.
* `minetest.unregister_biome(name)`
    * Unregisters the biome from the engine, and deletes the entry with key
      `name` from `minetest.registered_biomes`.
    * Warning: This alters the biome to biome ID correspondences, so any
      decorations or ores using the 'biomes' field must afterwards be cleared
      and re-registered.
* `minetest.register_decoration(decoration definition)`
    * Returns an integer object handle uniquely identifying the registered
      decoration on success. To get the decoration ID, use
      `minetest.get_decoration_id`.
    * The order of decoration registrations determines the order of decoration
      generation.
* `minetest.register_schematic(schematic definition)`
    * Returns an integer object handle uniquely identifying the registered
      schematic on success.
    * If the schematic is loaded from a file, the `name` field is set to the
      filename.
    * If the function is called when loading the mod, and `name` is a relative
      path, then the current mod path will be prepended to the schematic
      filename.
* `minetest.clear_registered_biomes()`
    * Clears all biomes currently registered.
    * Warning: Clearing and re-registering biomes alters the biome to biome ID
      correspondences, so any decorations or ores using the 'biomes' field must
      afterwards be cleared and re-registered.
* `minetest.clear_registered_decorations()`
    * Clears all decorations currently registered.
* `minetest.clear_registered_ores()`
    * Clears all ores currently registered.
* `minetest.clear_registered_schematics()`
    * Clears all schematics currently registered.

### Gameplay

* `minetest.register_craft(recipe)`
    * Check recipe table syntax for different types below.
* `minetest.clear_craft(recipe)`
    * Will erase existing craft based either on output item or on input recipe.
    * Specify either output or input only. If you specify both, input will be
      ignored. For input use the same recipe table syntax as for
      `minetest.register_craft(recipe)`. For output specify only the item,
      without a quantity.
    * Returns false if no erase candidate could be found, otherwise returns true.
    * **Warning**! The type field ("shaped", "cooking" or any other) will be
      ignored if the recipe contains output. Erasing is then done independently
      from the crafting method.
* `minetest.register_chatcommand(cmd, chatcommand definition)`
* `minetest.override_chatcommand(name, redefinition)`
    * Overrides fields of a chatcommand registered with `register_chatcommand`.
* `minetest.unregister_chatcommand(name)`
    * Unregisters a chatcommands registered with `register_chatcommand`.
* `minetest.register_privilege(name, definition)`
    * `definition` can be a description or a definition table (see [Privilege
      definition]).
    * If it is a description, the priv will be granted to singleplayer and admin
      by default.
    * To allow players with `basic_privs` to grant, see the `basic_privs`
      multicraft.conf setting.
* `minetest.register_authentication_handler(authentication handler definition)`
    * Registers an auth handler that overrides the builtin one.
    * This function can be called by a single mod once only.

      semi-frequent intervals as well as on server shutdown.
* `minetest.register_on_placenode(function(pos, newnode, placer, oldnode, itemstack, pointed_thing))`
    * Called when a node has been placed
    * If return `true` no item is taken from `itemstack`
    * `placer` may be any valid ObjectRef or nil.

            * `set_hp`: A mod or the engine called `set_hp` without
                        giving a type - use this for custom damage types.
            * `punch`: Was punched. `reason.object` will hold the puncher, or nil if none.
            * `fall`
            * `node_damage`: `damage_per_second` from a neighbouring node.
                             `reason.node` will hold the node name or nil.
            * `drown`
            * `respawn`
        * Any of the above types may have additional fields from mods.
        * `reason.from` will be `mod` or `engine`.
    * `modifier`: when true, the function should return the actual `hp_change`.
       Note: modifiers only get a temporary `hp_change` that can be modified by later modifiers.
       Modifiers can return true as a second argument to stop the execution of further functions.
       Non-modifiers receive the final HP change calculated by the modifiers.
* `minetest.register_on_dieplayer(function(ObjectRef, reason))`
    * Called when a player dies
    * `reason`: a PlayerHPChangeReason table, see register_on_player_hpchange

    * Called when a client attempts to log into an account.
    * `name`: The name of the account being authenticated.
    * `ip`: The IP address of the client
    * `is_success`: Whether the client was successfully authenticated
    * For newly registered accounts, `is_success` will always be true
* `minetest.register_on_auth_fail(function(name, ip))`
    * Deprecated: use `minetest.register_on_authplayer(name, ip, is_success)` instead.
* `minetest.register_on_cheat(function(ObjectRef, cheat))`
    * Called when a player cheats
    * `cheat`: `{type=<cheat_type>}`, where `<cheat_type>` is one of:
        * `moved_too_fast`

        * `dug_too_fast`
* `minetest.register_on_chat_message(function(name, message))`
    * Called always when a player says something
    * Return `true` to mark the message as handled, which means that it will
      not be sent to other players.
* `minetest.register_on_chatcommand(function(name, command, params))`
    * Called always when a chatcommand is triggered, before `minetest.registered_chatcommands`
      is checked to see if the command exists, but after the input is parsed.
    * Return `true` to mark the command as handled, which means that the default
      handlers will be prevented.
* `minetest.register_on_player_receive_fields(function(player, formname, fields))`
    * Called when the server received input from `player` in a formspec with
      the given `formname`. Specifically, this is called on any of the
      following events:
          * a button was pressed,
          * Enter was pressed while the focus was on a text field
          * a checkbox was toggled,
          * something was selected in a dropdown list,
          * a different tab was selected,
          * selection was changed in a textlist or table,
          * an entry was double-clicked in a textlist or table,
          * a scrollbar was moved, or
          * the form was actively closed by the player.
    * Fields are sent for formspec elements which define a field. `fields`
      is a table containing each formspecs element value (as string), with
      the `name` parameter as index for each. The value depends on the
      formspec element type:
        * `animated_image`: Returns the index of the current frame.
        * `button` and variants: If pressed, contains the user-facing button
          text as value. If not pressed, is `nil`
        * `field`, `textarea` and variants: Text in the field
        * `dropdown`: Either the index or value, depending on the `index event`
          dropdown argument.
        * `tabheader`: Tab index, starting with `"1"` (only if tab changed)
        * `checkbox`: `"true"` if checked, `"false"` if unchecked
        * `textlist`: See `minetest.explode_textlist_event`
        * `table`: See `minetest.explode_table_event`
        * `scrollbar`: See `minetest.explode_scrollbar_event`
        * Special case: `["quit"]="true"` is sent when the user actively
          closed the form by mouse click, keypress or through a button_exit[]
          element.
        * Special case: `["key_enter"]="true"` is sent when the user pressed
          the Enter key and the focus was either nowhere (causing the formspec
          to be closed) or on a button. If the focus was on a text field,
          additionally, the index `key_enter_field` contains the name of the
          text field. See also: `field_close_on_enter`.
    * Newest functions are called first
    * If function returns `true`, remaining functions are not called
* `minetest.register_on_craft(function(itemstack, player, old_craft_grid, craft_inv))`
    * Called when `player` crafts something
    * `itemstack` is the output
    * `old_craft_grid` contains the recipe (Note: the one in the inventory is
      cleared).
    * `craft_inv` is the inventory with the crafting grid
    * Return either an `ItemStack`, to replace the output, or `nil`, to not
      modify it.
* `minetest.register_craft_predict(function(itemstack, player, old_craft_grid, craft_inv))`
    * The same as before, except that it is called before the player crafts, to
      make craft prediction, and it should not change anything.
* `minetest.register_allow_player_inventory_action(function(player, action, inventory, inventory_info))`
    * Determines how much of a stack may be taken, put or moved to a
      player inventory.
    * `player` (type `ObjectRef`) is the player who modified the inventory
      `inventory` (type `InvRef`).
    * List of possible `action` (string) values and their
      `inventory_info` (table) contents:
        * `move`: `{from_list=string, to_list=string, from_index=number, to_index=number, count=number}`
        * `put`:  `{listname=string, index=number, stack=ItemStack}`
        * `take`: Same as `put`
    * Return a numeric value to limit the amount of items to be taken, put or
      moved. A value of `-1` for `take` will make the source stack infinite.
* `minetest.register_on_player_inventory_action(function(player, action, inventory, inventory_info))`
    * Called after a take, put or move event from/to/in a player inventory
    * Function arguments: see `minetest.register_allow_player_inventory_action`
    * Does not accept or handle any return value.
* `minetest.register_on_protection_violation(function(pos, name))`
    * Called by `builtin` and mods when a player violates protection at a
      position (eg, digs a node or punches a protected entity).
    * The registered functions can be called using
      `minetest.record_protection_violation`.
    * The provided function should check that the position is protected by the
      mod calling this function before it prints a message, if it does, to
      allow for multiple protection mods.
* `minetest.register_on_item_eat(function(hp_change, replace_with_item, itemstack, user, pointed_thing))`
    * Called when an item is eaten, by `minetest.item_eat`
    * Return `itemstack` to cancel the default item eat response (i.e.: hp increase).
* `minetest.register_on_priv_grant(function(name, granter, priv))`
    * Called when `granter` grants the priv `priv` to `name`.
    * Note that the callback will be called twice if it's done by a player,
      once with granter being the player name, and again with granter being nil.
* `minetest.register_on_priv_revoke(function(name, revoker, priv))`
    * Called when `revoker` revokes the priv `priv` from `name`.
    * Note that the callback will be called twice if it's done by a player,
      once with revoker being the player name, and again with revoker being nil.
* `minetest.register_can_bypass_userlimit(function(name, ip))`
    * Called when `name` user connects with `ip`.
    * Return `true` to by pass the player limit
* `minetest.register_on_modchannel_message(function(channel_name, sender, message))`
    * Called when an incoming mod channel message is received
    * You should have joined some channels to receive events.
    * If message comes from a server mod, `sender` field is an empty string.

Setting-related
---------------

* `minetest.settings`: Settings object containing all of the settings from the
  main config file (`multicraft.conf`).
* `minetest.setting_get_pos(name)`: Loads a setting from the main settings and
  parses it as a position (in the format `(1,2,3)`). Returns a position or nil.

Authentication
--------------

* `minetest.string_to_privs(str[, delim])`:
    * Converts string representation of privs into table form
    * `delim`: String separating the privs. Defaults to `","`.
    * Returns `{ priv1 = true, ... }`
* `minetest.privs_to_string(privs[, delim])`:
    * Returns the string representation of `privs`
    * `delim`: String to delimit privs. Defaults to `","`.
* `minetest.get_player_privs(name) -> {priv1=true,...}`
* `minetest.check_player_privs(player_or_name, ...)`:
  returns `bool, missing_privs`
    * A quickhand for checking privileges.
    * `player_or_name`: Either a Player object or the name of a player.
    * `...` is either a list of strings, e.g. `"priva", "privb"` or
      a table, e.g. `{ priva = true, privb = true }`.

* `minetest.check_password_entry(name, entry, password)`
    * Returns true if the "password entry" for a player with name matches given
      password, false otherwise.
    * The "password entry" is the password representation generated by the
      engine as returned as part of a `get_auth()` call on the auth handler.
    * Only use this function for making it possible to log in via password from
      external protocols such as IRC, other uses are frowned upon.
* `minetest.get_password_hash(name, raw_password)`
    * Convert a name-password pair to a password hash that Minetest can use.
    * The returned value alone is not a good basis for password checks based
      on comparing the password hash in the database with the password hash
      from the function, with an externally provided password, as the hash
      in the db might use the new SRP verifier format.
    * For this purpose, use `minetest.check_password_entry` instead.
* `minetest.get_player_ip(name)`: returns an IP address string for the player
  `name`.
    * The player needs to be online for this to be successful.

* `minetest.get_auth_handler()`: Return the currently active auth handler
    * See the [Authentication handler definition]
    * Use this to e.g. get the authentication data for a player:
      `local auth_data = minetest.get_auth_handler().get_auth(playername)`
* `minetest.notify_authentication_modified(name)`
    * Must be called by the authentication handler for privilege changes.
    * `name`: string; if omitted, all auth data should be considered modified
* `minetest.set_player_password(name, password_hash)`: Set password hash of
  player `name`.
* `minetest.set_player_privs(name, {priv1=true,...})`: Set privileges of player
  `name`.
* `minetest.auth_reload()`
    * See `reload()` in authentication handler definition

`minetest.set_player_password`, `minetest.set_player_privs`,
`minetest.get_player_privs` and `minetest.auth_reload` call the authentication
handler.

Chat
----

* `minetest.chat_send_all(text)`
* `minetest.chat_send_player(name, text)`
* `minetest.format_chat_message(name, message)`
    * Used by the server to format a chat message, based on the setting `chat_message_format`.
      Refer to the documentation of the setting for a list of valid placeholders.
    * Takes player name and message, and returns the formatted string to be sent to players.
    * Can be redefined by mods if required, for things like colored names or messages.
    * **Only** the first occurrence of each placeholder will be replaced.

Environment access
------------------

* `minetest.set_node(pos, node)`
* `minetest.add_node(pos, node)`: alias to `minetest.set_node`
    * Set node at position `pos`
    * `node`: table `{name=string, param1=number, param2=number}`
    * If param1 or param2 is omitted, it's set to `0`.
    * e.g. `minetest.set_node({x=0, y=10, z=0}, {name="default:wood"})`
* `minetest.bulk_set_node({pos1, pos2, pos3, ...}, node)`
    * Set node on all positions set in the first argument.
    * e.g. `minetest.bulk_set_node({{x=0, y=1, z=1}, {x=1, y=2, z=2}}, {name="default:stone"})`
    * For node specification or position syntax see `minetest.set_node` call
    * Faster than set_node due to single call, but still considerably slower
      than Lua Voxel Manipulators (LVM) for large numbers of nodes.
      Unlike LVMs, this will call node callbacks. It also allows setting nodes
      in spread out positions which would cause LVMs to waste memory.
      For setting a cube, this is 1.3x faster than set_node whereas LVM is 20
      times faster.
* `minetest.swap_node(pos, node)`
    * Set node at position, but don't remove metadata
* `minetest.remove_node(pos)`
    * By default it does the same as `minetest.set_node(pos, {name="air"})`
* `minetest.get_node(pos)`
    * Returns the node at the given position as table in the format
      `{name="node_name", param1=0, param2=0}`,
      returns `{name="ignore", param1=0, param2=0}` for unloaded areas.
* `minetest.get_node_or_nil(pos)`
    * Same as `get_node` but returns `nil` for unloaded areas.
* `minetest.get_node_light(pos, timeofday)`
    * Gets the light value at the given position. Note that the light value
      "inside" the node at the given position is returned, so you usually want
      to get the light value of a neighbor.
    * `pos`: The position where to measure the light.
    * `timeofday`: `nil` for current time, `0` for night, `0.5` for day
    * Returns a number between `0` and `15` or `nil`
    * `nil` is returned e.g. when the map isn't loaded at `pos`
* `minetest.get_natural_light(pos[, timeofday])`
    * Figures out the sunlight (or moonlight) value at pos at the given time of
      day.
    * `pos`: The position of the node
    * `timeofday`: `nil` for current time, `0` for night, `0.5` for day
    * Returns a number between `0` and `15` or `nil`
    * This function tests 203 nodes in the worst case, which happens very
      unlikely
* `minetest.get_artificial_light(param1)`
    * Calculates the artificial light (light from e.g. torches) value from the
      `param1` value.
    * `param1`: The param1 value of a `paramtype = "light"` node.
    * Returns a number between `0` and `15`
    * Currently it's the same as `math.floor(param1 / 16)`, except that it
      ensures compatibility.
* `minetest.place_node(pos, node)`
    * Place node with the same effects that a player would cause
* `minetest.dig_node(pos)`
    * Dig node with the same effects that a player would cause
    * Returns `true` if successful, `false` on failure (e.g. protected location)
* `minetest.punch_node(pos)`
    * Punch node with the same effects that a player would cause
* `minetest.spawn_falling_node(pos)`
    * Change node into falling node
    * Returns `true` if successful, `false` on failure

* `minetest.find_nodes_with_meta(pos1, pos2)`
    * Get a table of positions of nodes that have metadata within a region
      {pos1, pos2}.
* `minetest.get_meta(pos)`
    * Get a `NodeMetaRef` at that position
* `minetest.get_node_timer(pos)`
    * Get `NodeTimerRef`

* `minetest.add_entity(pos, name, [staticdata])`: Spawn Lua-defined entity at
  position.

    * `max_drop`: maximum height difference to consider droppable
    * `algorithm`: One of `"A*_noprefetch"` (default), `"A*"`, `"Dijkstra"`.

    * resets the light in a cuboid-shaped part of
      the map and removes lighting bugs.
    * Loads the area if it is not loaded.
    * `pos1` is the corner of the cuboid with the least coordinates
      (in node coordinates), inclusive.
    * `pos2` is the opposite corner of the cuboid, inclusive.
    * The actual updated cuboid might be larger than the specified one,
      because only whole map blocks can be updated.
      The actual updated area consists of those map blocks that intersect
      with the given cuboid.
    * However, the neighborhood of the updated area might change
      as well, as light can spread out of the cuboid, also light
      might be removed.

      of nodes to fall.
* `minetest.get_spawn_level(x, z)`
    * Returns a player spawn y co-ordinate for the provided (x, z)
      co-ordinates, or `nil` for an unsuitable spawn point.
    * For most mapgens a 'suitable spawn point' is one with y between
      `water_level` and `water_level + 16`, and in mgv7 well away from rivers,
      so `nil` will be returned for many (x, z) co-ordinates.
    * The spawn level returned is for a player spawn in unmodified terrain.
    * The spawn level is intentionally above terrain level to cope with
      full-node biome 'dust' nodes.
 * `minetest.set_world_spawnpoint([pos])`
    * Sets the world-specific spawnpoint to pos (or `nil` to reset).

    * `param2` overrides `facedir` and wallmounted `param2`
    * `prevent_after_place`: if set to `true`, `after_place_node` is not called
      for the newly placed node to prevent a callback and placement loop
    * returns `itemstack, position`
      * `position`: the location the node was placed to. `nil` if nothing was placed.
* `minetest.item_place_object(itemstack, placer, pointed_thing)`
    * Place item as-is
    * returns the leftover itemstack
    * **Note**: This function is deprecated and will never be called.
* `minetest.item_place(itemstack, placer, pointed_thing[, param2])`
    * Wrapper that calls `minetest.item_place_node` if appropriate
    * Calls `on_rightclick` of `pointed_thing.under` if defined instead
    * **Note**: is not called when wielded item overrides `on_place`
    * `param2` overrides facedir and wallmounted `param2`
    * returns `itemstack, position`
      * `position`: the location the node was placed to. `nil` if nothing was placed.
* `minetest.item_drop(itemstack, dropper, pos)`
    * Drop the item
    * returns the leftover itemstack
* `minetest.item_eat(hp_change[, replace_with_item])`
    * Returns `function(itemstack, user, pointed_thing)` as a
      function wrapper for `minetest.do_item_eat`.
    * `replace_with_item` is the itemstring which is added to the inventory.
      If the player is eating a stack, then replace_with_item goes to a
      different spot.

Defaults for the `on_punch` and `on_dig` node definition callbacks
------------------------------------------------------------------

* `minetest.node_punch(pos, node, puncher, pointed_thing)`
    * Calls functions registered by `minetest.register_on_punchnode()`
* `minetest.node_dig(pos, node, digger)`
    * Checks if node can be dug, puts item into inventory, removes node
    * Calls functions registered by `minetest.registered_on_dignodes()`

Sounds
------

* `minetest.sound_play(spec, parameters, [ephemeral])`: returns a handle
    * `spec` is a `SimpleSoundSpec`
    * `parameters` is a sound parameter table
    * `ephemeral` is a boolean (default: false)
      Ephemeral sounds will not return a handle and can't be stopped or faded.
      It is recommend to use this for short sounds that happen in response to
      player actions (e.g. door closing).
* `minetest.sound_stop(handle)`
    * `handle` is a handle returned by `minetest.sound_play`
* `minetest.sound_fade(handle, step, gain)`
    * `handle` is a handle returned by `minetest.sound_play`
    * `step` determines how fast a sound will fade.
      The gain will change by this much per second,
      until it reaches the target gain.
      Note: Older versions used a signed step. This is deprecated, but old
      code will still work. (the client uses abs(step) to correct it)
    * `gain` the target gain for the fade.
      Fading to zero will delete the sound.

Timing
------

* `minetest.after(time, func, ...)` : returns job table to use as below.
    * Call the function `func` after `time` seconds, may be fractional
    * Optional: Variable number of arguments that are passed to `func`

* `job:cancel()`
    * Cancels the job function from being called

Server
------

* `minetest.request_shutdown([message],[reconnect],[delay])`: request for
  server shutdown. Will display `message` to clients.
    * `reconnect` == true displays a reconnect button
    * `delay` adds an optional delay (in seconds) before shutdown.
      Negative delay cancels the current active shutdown.
      Zero delay triggers an immediate shutdown.
* `minetest.cancel_shutdown_requests()`: cancel current delayed shutdown
* `minetest.get_server_status(name, joined)`
    * Returns the server status string when a player joins or when the command
      `/status` is called. Returns `nil` or an empty string when the message is
      disabled.
    * `joined`: Boolean value, indicates whether the function was called when
      a player joined.
    * This function may be overwritten by mods to customize the status message.
* `minetest.get_server_uptime()`: returns the server uptime in seconds
* `minetest.remove_player(name)`: remove player from database (if they are not
  connected).
    * As auth data is not removed, minetest.player_exists will continue to
      return true. Call the below method as well if you want to remove auth
      data too.
    * Returns a code (0: successful, 1: no such player, 2: player is connected)
* `minetest.remove_player_auth(name)`: remove player authentication data
    * Returns boolean indicating success (false if player nonexistant)
* `minetest.dynamic_add_media(filepath, callback)`
    * `filepath`: path to a media file on the filesystem
    * `callback`: function with arguments `name`, where name is a player name
      (previously there was no callback argument; omitting it is deprecated)
    * Adds the file to the media sent to clients by the server on startup
      and also pushes this file to already connected clients.
      The file must be a supported image, sound or model format. It must not be
      modified, deleted, moved or renamed after calling this function.
      The list of dynamically added media is not persisted.
    * Returns false on error, true if the request was accepted
    * The given callback will be called for every player as soon as the
      media is available on the client.
      Old clients that lack support for this feature will not see the media
      unless they reconnect to the server. (callback won't be called)
    * Since media transferred this way currently does not use client caching
       or HTTP transfers, dynamic media should not be used with big files.

Bans
----

* `minetest.get_ban_list()`: returns a list of all bans formatted as string
* `minetest.get_ban_description(ip_or_name)`: returns list of bans matching
  IP address or name formatted as string
* `minetest.ban_player(name)`: ban the IP of a currently connected player
    * Returns boolean indicating success
* `minetest.unban_player_or_ip(ip_or_name)`: remove ban record matching
  IP address or name
* `minetest.kick_player(name, [reason])`: disconnect a player with an optional
  reason.
    * Returns boolean indicating success (false if player nonexistant)

Particles
---------

* `minetest.add_particle(particle definition)`
    * Deprecated: `minetest.add_particle(pos, velocity, acceleration,
      expirationtime, size, collisiondetection, texture, playername)`

* `minetest.add_particlespawner(particlespawner definition)`
    * Add a `ParticleSpawner`, an object that spawns an amount of particles
      over `time` seconds.
    * Returns an `id`, and -1 if adding didn't succeed
    * Deprecated: `minetest.add_particlespawner(amount, time,
      minpos, maxpos,
      minvel, maxvel,
      minacc, maxacc,
      minexptime, maxexptime,
      minsize, maxsize,
      collisiondetection, texture, playername)`

* `minetest.delete_particlespawner(id, player)`
    * Delete `ParticleSpawner` with `id` (return value from
      `minetest.add_particlespawner`).
    * If playername is specified, only deletes on the player's client,
      otherwise on all clients.

Schematics
----------

* `minetest.create_schematic(p1, p2, probability_list, filename, slice_prob_list)`
    * Create a schematic from the volume of map specified by the box formed by
      p1 and p2.
    * Apply the specified probability and per-node force-place to the specified
      nodes according to the `probability_list`.
        * `probability_list` is an array of tables containing two fields, `pos`
          and `prob`.
            * `pos` is the 3D vector specifying the absolute coordinates of the
              node being modified,
            * `prob` is an integer value from `0` to `255` that encodes
              probability and per-node force-place. Probability has levels
              0-127, then 128 may be added to encode per-node force-place.
              For probability stated as 0-255, divide by 2 and round down to
              get values 0-127, then add 128 to apply per-node force-place.
            * If there are two or more entries with the same pos value, the
              last entry is used.
            * If `pos` is not inside the box formed by `p1` and `p2`, it is
              ignored.
            * If `probability_list` equals `nil`, no probabilities are applied.
    * Apply the specified probability to the specified horizontal slices
      according to the `slice_prob_list`.
        * `slice_prob_list` is an array of tables containing two fields, `ypos`
          and `prob`.
            * `ypos` indicates the y position of the slice with a probability
              applied, the lowest slice being `ypos = 0`.
            * If slice probability list equals `nil`, no slice probabilities
              are applied.
    * Saves schematic in the Minetest Schematic format to filename.

* `minetest.place_schematic(pos, schematic, rotation, replacements, force_placement, flags)`
    * Place the schematic specified by schematic (see [Schematic specifier]) at
      `pos`.
    * `rotation` can equal `"0"`, `"90"`, `"180"`, `"270"`, or `"random"`.
    * If the `rotation` parameter is omitted, the schematic is not rotated.
    * `replacements` = `{["old_name"] = "convert_to", ...}`
    * `force_placement` is a boolean indicating whether nodes other than `air`
      and `ignore` are replaced by the schematic.
    * Returns nil if the schematic could not be loaded.
    * **Warning**: Once you have loaded a schematic from a file, it will be
      cached. Future calls will always use the cached version and the
      replacement list defined for it, regardless of whether the file or the
      replacement list parameter have changed. The only way to load the file
      anew is to restart the server.
    * `flags` is a flag field with the available flags:
        * place_center_x
        * place_center_y
        * place_center_z

* `minetest.place_schematic_on_vmanip(vmanip, pos, schematic, rotation, replacement, force_placement, flags)`:
    * This function is analogous to minetest.place_schematic, but places a
      schematic onto the specified VoxelManip object `vmanip` instead of the
      map.
    * Returns false if any part of the schematic was cut-off due to the
      VoxelManip not containing the full area required, and true if the whole
      schematic was able to fit.
    * Returns nil if the schematic could not be loaded.
    * After execution, any external copies of the VoxelManip contents are
      invalidated.
    * `flags` is a flag field with the available flags:
        * place_center_x
        * place_center_y
        * place_center_z

* `minetest.serialize_schematic(schematic, format, options)`
    * Return the serialized schematic specified by schematic
      (see [Schematic specifier])
    * in the `format` of either "mts" or "lua".
    * "mts" - a string containing the binary MTS data used in the MTS file
      format.
    * "lua" - a string containing Lua code representing the schematic in table
      format.
    * `options` is a table containing the following optional parameters:
        * If `lua_use_comments` is true and `format` is "lua", the Lua code
          generated will have (X, Z) position comments for every X row
          generated in the schematic data for easier reading.
        * If `lua_num_indent_spaces` is a nonzero number and `format` is "lua",
          the Lua code generated will use that number of spaces as indentation
          instead of a tab character.

* `minetest.read_schematic(schematic, options)`
    * Returns a Lua table representing the schematic (see: [Schematic specifier])
    * `schematic` is the schematic to read (see: [Schematic specifier])
    * `options` is a table containing the following optional parameters:
        * `write_yslice_prob`: string value:
            * `none`: no `write_yslice_prob` table is inserted,
            * `low`: only probabilities that are not 254 or 255 are written in
              the `write_ylisce_prob` table,
            * `all`: write all probabilities to the `write_yslice_prob` table.
            * The default for this option is `all`.
            * Any invalid value will be interpreted as `all`.

HTTP Requests
-------------

* `minetest.request_http_api()`:
    * returns `HTTPApiTable` containing http functions if the calling mod has
      been granted access by being listed in the `secure.http_mods` or
      `secure.trusted_mods` setting, otherwise returns `nil`.
    * The returned table contains the functions `fetch`, `fetch_async` and
      `fetch_async_get` described below.
    * Only works at init time and must be called from the mod's main scope
      (not from a function).
    * Function only exists if minetest server was built with cURL support.
    * **DO NOT ALLOW ANY OTHER MODS TO ACCESS THE RETURNED TABLE, STORE IT IN
      A LOCAL VARIABLE!**
* `HTTPApiTable.fetch(HTTPRequest req, callback)`
    * Performs given request asynchronously and calls callback upon completion
    * callback: `function(HTTPRequestResult res)`
    * Use this HTTP function if you are unsure, the others are for advanced use
* `HTTPApiTable.fetch_async(HTTPRequest req)`: returns handle
    * Performs given request asynchronously and returns handle for
      `HTTPApiTable.fetch_async_get`
* `HTTPApiTable.fetch_async_get(handle)`: returns HTTPRequestResult
    * Return response data for given asynchronous HTTP request

Storage API
-----------

* `minetest.get_mod_storage()`:
    * returns reference to mod private `StorageRef`
    * must be called during mod load time

Misc.
-----

* `minetest.get_connected_players()`: returns list of `ObjectRefs`
* `minetest.is_player(obj)`: boolean, whether `obj` is a player
* `minetest.player_exists(name)`: boolean, whether player exists
  (regardless of online status)
* `minetest.hud_replace_builtin(name, hud_definition)`
    * Replaces definition of a builtin hud element
    * `name`: `"breath"` or `"health"`
    * `hud_definition`: definition to replace builtin definition
* `minetest.send_join_message(player_name)`
    * This function can be overridden by mods to change the join message.
* `minetest.send_leave_message(player_name, timed_out)`
    * This function can be overridden by mods to change the leave message.
* `minetest.hash_node_position(pos)`: returns an 48-bit integer
    * `pos`: table {x=number, y=number, z=number},
    * Gives a unique hash number for a node position (16+16+16=48bit)
* `minetest.get_position_from_hash(hash)`: returns a position
    * Inverse transform of `minetest.hash_node_position`
* `minetest.get_item_group(name, group)`: returns a rating
    * Get rating of a group of an item. (`0` means: not in group)
* `minetest.get_node_group(name, group)`: returns a rating
    * Deprecated: An alias for the former.
* `minetest.raillike_group(name)`: returns a rating
    * Returns rating of the connect_to_raillike group corresponding to name
    * If name is not yet the name of a connect_to_raillike group, a new group
      id is created, with that name.
* `minetest.get_content_id(name)`: returns an integer
    * Gets the internal content ID of `name`
* `minetest.get_name_from_content_id(content_id)`: returns a string
    * Gets the name of the content with that content ID
* `minetest.parse_json(string[, nullvalue])`: returns something
    * Convert a string containing JSON data into the Lua equivalent
    * `nullvalue`: returned in place of the JSON null; defaults to `nil`
    * On success returns a table, a string, a number, a boolean or `nullvalue`
    * On failure outputs an error message and returns `nil`
    * Example: `parse_json("[10, {\"a\":false}]")`, returns `{10, {a = false}}`
* `minetest.write_json(data[, styled])`: returns a string or `nil` and an error
  message.
    * Convert a Lua table into a JSON string
    * styled: Outputs in a human-readable format if this is set, defaults to
      false.
    * Unserializable things like functions and userdata will cause an error.
    * **Warning**: JSON is more strict than the Lua table format.
        1. You can only use strings and positive integers of at least one as
           keys.
        2. You can not mix string and integer keys.
           This is due to the fact that JSON has two distinct array and object
           values.
    * Example: `write_json({10, {a = false}})`,
      returns `"[10, {\"a\": false}]"`
* `minetest.serialize(table)`: returns a string
    * Convert a table containing tables, strings, numbers, booleans and `nil`s
      into string form readable by `minetest.deserialize`
    * Example: `serialize({foo='bar'})`, returns `'return { ["foo"] = "bar" }'`
* `minetest.deserialize(string[, safe])`: returns a table
    * Convert a string returned by `minetest.serialize` into a table
    * `string` is loaded in an empty sandbox environment.
    * Will load functions if safe is false or omitted. Although these functions
      cannot directly access the global environment, they could bypass this
      restriction with maliciously crafted Lua bytecode if mod security is
      disabled.
    * This function should not be used on untrusted data, regardless of the
     value of `safe`. It is fine to serialize then deserialize user-provided
     data, but directly providing user input to deserialize is always unsafe.
    * Example: `deserialize('return { ["foo"] = "bar" }')`,
      returns `{foo='bar'}`
    * Example: `deserialize('print("foo")')`, returns `nil`
      (function call fails), returns
      `error:[string "print("foo")"]:1: attempt to call global 'print' (a nil value)`
* `minetest.compress(data, method, ...)`: returns `compressed_data`
    * Compress a string of data.
    * `method` is a string identifying the compression method to be used.
    * Supported compression methods:
        * Deflate (zlib): `"deflate"`
    * `...` indicates method-specific arguments. Currently defined arguments
      are:
        * Deflate: `level` - Compression level, `0`-`9` or `nil`.
* `minetest.decompress(compressed_data, method, ...)`: returns data
    * Decompress a string of data (using ZLib).
    * See documentation on `minetest.compress()` for supported compression
      methods.
    * `...` indicates method-specific arguments. Currently, no methods use this
* `minetest.rgba(red, green, blue[, alpha])`: returns a string
    * Each argument is a 8 Bit unsigned integer
    * Returns the ColorString from rgb or rgba values
    * Example: `minetest.rgba(10, 20, 30, 40)`, returns `"#0A141E28"`
* `minetest.encode_base64(string)`: returns string encoded in base64
    * Encodes a string in base64.
* `minetest.decode_base64(string)`: returns string or nil for invalid base64
    * Decodes a string encoded in base64.
* `minetest.is_protected(pos, name)`: returns boolean
    * Returning `true` restricts the player `name` from modifying (i.e. digging,
       placing) the node at position `pos`.
    * `name` will be `""` for non-players or unknown players.
    * This function should be overridden by protection mods. It is highly
      recommended to grant access to players with the `protection_bypass` privilege.
    * Cache and call the old version of this function if the position is
      not protected by the mod. This will allow using multiple protection mods.
    * Example:

          local old_is_protected = minetest.is_protected
          function minetest.is_protected(pos, name)
              if mymod:position_protected_from(pos, name) then
                  return true
              end
              return old_is_protected(pos, name)
          end
* `minetest.record_protection_violation(pos, name)`
    * This function calls functions registered with
      `minetest.register_on_protection_violation`.
* `minetest.is_creative_enabled(name)`: returns boolean
    * Returning `true` means that Creative Mode is enabled for player `name`.
    * `name` will be `""` for non-players or if the player is unknown.
    * This function should be overridden by Creative Mode-related mods to
      implement a per-player Creative Mode.
    * By default, this function returns `true` if the setting
      `creative_mode` is `true` and `false` otherwise.
* `minetest.is_area_protected(pos1, pos2, player_name, interval)`
    * Returns the position of the first node that `player_name` may not modify
      in the specified cuboid between `pos1` and `pos2`.
    * Returns `false` if no protections were found.
    * Applies `is_protected()` to a 3D lattice of points in the defined volume.
      The points are spaced evenly throughout the volume and have a spacing
      similar to, but no larger than, `interval`.
    * All corners and edges of the defined volume are checked.
    * `interval` defaults to 4.
    * `interval` should be carefully chosen and maximised to avoid an excessive
      number of points being checked.
    * Like `minetest.is_protected`, this function may be extended or
      overwritten by mods to provide a faster implementation to check the
      cuboid for intersections.
* `minetest.rotate_and_place(itemstack, placer, pointed_thing[, infinitestacks,
  orient_flags, prevent_after_place])`
    * Attempt to predict the desired orientation of the facedir-capable node
      defined by `itemstack`, and place it accordingly (on-wall, on the floor,
      or hanging from the ceiling).
    * `infinitestacks`: if `true`, the itemstack is not changed. Otherwise the
      stacks are handled normally.
    * `orient_flags`: Optional table containing extra tweaks to the placement code:
        * `invert_wall`:   if `true`, place wall-orientation on the ground and
          ground-orientation on the wall.
        * `force_wall` :   if `true`, always place the node in wall orientation.
        * `force_ceiling`: if `true`, always place on the ceiling.
        * `force_floor`:   if `true`, always place the node on the floor.
        * `force_facedir`: if `true`, forcefully reset the facedir to north
          when placing on the floor or ceiling.
        * The first four options are mutually-exclusive; the last in the list
          takes precedence over the first.
    * `prevent_after_place` is directly passed to `minetest.item_place_node`
    * Returns the new itemstack after placement
* `minetest.rotate_node(itemstack, placer, pointed_thing)`
    * calls `rotate_and_place()` with `infinitestacks` set according to the state
      of the creative mode setting, checks for "sneak" to set the `invert_wall`
      parameter and `prevent_after_place` set to `true`.

* `minetest.calculate_knockback(player, hitter, time_from_last_punch,
  tool_capabilities, dir, distance, damage)`
    * Returns the amount of knockback applied on the punched player.
    * Arguments are equivalent to `register_on_punchplayer`, except the following:
        * `distance`: distance between puncher and punched player
    * This function can be overriden by mods that wish to modify this behaviour.
    * You may want to cache and call the old function to allow multiple mods to
      change knockback behaviour.

* `minetest.forceload_block(pos[, transient])`
    * forceloads the position `pos`.
    * returns `true` if area could be forceloaded
    * If `transient` is `false` or absent, the forceload will be persistent
      (saved between server runs). If `true`, the forceload will be transient
      (not saved between server runs).

* `minetest.forceload_free_block(pos[, transient])`
    * stops forceloading the position `pos`
    * If `transient` is `false` or absent, frees a persistent forceload.
      If `true`, frees a transient forceload.

* `minetest.request_insecure_environment()`: returns an environment containing
  insecure functions if the calling mod has been listed as trusted in the
  `secure.trusted_mods` setting or security is disabled, otherwise returns
  `nil`.
    * Only works at init time and must be called from the mod's main scope
      (ie: the init.lua of the mod, not from another Lua file or within a function).
    * **DO NOT ALLOW ANY OTHER MODS TO ACCESS THE RETURNED ENVIRONMENT, STORE
      IT IN A LOCAL VARIABLE!**

Class reference
===============

Sorted alphabetically.

`AreaStore`
-----------

A fast access data structure to store areas, and find areas near a given
position or area.
Every area has a `data` string attribute to store additional information.
You can create an empty `AreaStore` by calling `AreaStore()`, or
`AreaStore(type_name)`. The mod decides where to save and load AreaStore.
If you chose the parameter-less constructor, a fast implementation will be
automatically chosen for you.

### Methods

* `get_area(id, include_borders, include_data)`
    * Returns the area information about the specified ID.
    * Returned values are either of these:

            nil  -- Area not found
            true -- Without `include_borders` and `include_data`
            {
                min = pos, max = pos -- `include_borders == true`
                data = string        -- `include_data == true`
            }

* `get_areas_for_pos(pos, include_borders, include_data)`
    * Returns all areas as table, indexed by the area ID.
    * Table values: see `get_area`.
* `get_areas_in_area(edge1, edge2, accept_overlap, include_borders, include_data)`
    * Returns all areas that contain all nodes inside the area specified by `edge1`
      and `edge2` (inclusive).
    * `accept_overlap`: if `true`, areas are returned that have nodes in
      common (intersect) with the specified area.
    * Returns the same values as `get_areas_for_pos`.
* `insert_area(edge1, edge2, data, [id])`: inserts an area into the store.
    * Returns the new area's ID, or nil if the insertion failed.
    * The (inclusive) positions `edge1` and `edge2` describe the area.
    * `data` is a string stored with the area.
    * `id` (optional): will be used as the internal area ID if it is an unique
      number between 0 and 2^32-2.
* `reserve(count)`: reserves resources for at most `count` many contained
  areas.
  Only needed for efficiency, and only some implementations profit.
* `remove_area(id)`: removes the area with the given id from the store, returns
  success.
* `set_cache_params(params)`: sets params for the included prefiltering cache.
  Calling invalidates the cache, so that its elements have to be newly
  generated.
    * `params` is a table with the following fields:

          enabled = boolean,   -- Whether to enable, default true
          block_radius = int,  -- The radius (in nodes) of the areas the cache
                               -- generates prefiltered lists for, minimum 16,
                               -- default 64
          limit = int,         -- The cache size, minimum 20, default 1000
* `to_string()`: Experimental. Returns area store serialized as a (binary)
  string.
* `to_file(filename)`: Experimental. Like `to_string()`, but writes the data to
  a file.
* `from_string(str)`: Experimental. Deserializes string and loads it into the
  AreaStore.
  Returns success and, optionally, an error message.
* `from_file(filename)`: Experimental. Like `from_string()`, but reads the data
  from a file.

`InvRef`
--------

An `InvRef` is a reference to an inventory.

### Methods

* `is_empty(listname)`: return `true` if list is empty
* `get_size(listname)`: get size of a list
* `set_size(listname, size)`: set size of a list
    * returns `false` on error (e.g. invalid `listname` or `size`)
* `get_width(listname)`: get width of a list
* `set_width(listname, width)`: set width of list; currently used for crafting
* `get_stack(listname, i)`: get a copy of stack index `i` in list
* `set_stack(listname, i, stack)`: copy `stack` to index `i` in list
* `get_list(listname)`: return full list
* `set_list(listname, list)`: set full list (size will not change)
* `get_lists()`: returns list of inventory lists
* `set_lists(lists)`: sets inventory lists (size will not change)
* `add_item(listname, stack)`: add item somewhere in list, returns leftover
  `ItemStack`.
* `room_for_item(listname, stack):` returns `true` if the stack of items
  can be fully added to the list
* `contains_item(listname, stack, [match_meta])`: returns `true` if
  the stack of items can be fully taken from the list.
  If `match_meta` is false, only the items' names are compared
  (default: `false`).
* `remove_item(listname, stack)`: take as many items as specified from the
  list, returns the items that were actually removed (as an `ItemStack`)
  -- note that any item metadata is ignored, so attempting to remove a specific
  unique item this way will likely remove the wrong one -- to do that use
  `set_stack` with an empty `ItemStack`.
* `get_location()`: returns a location compatible to
  `minetest.get_inventory(location)`.
    * returns `{type="undefined"}` in case location is not known

### Callbacks

Detached & nodemeta inventories provide the following callbacks for move actions:

#### Before

The `allow_*` callbacks return how many items can be moved.

* `allow_move`/`allow_metadata_inventory_move`: Moving items in the inventory
* `allow_take`/`allow_metadata_inventory_take`: Taking items from the inventory
* `allow_put`/`allow_metadata_inventory_put`: Putting items to the inventory

#### After

The `on_*` callbacks are called after the items have been placed in the inventories.

* `on_move`/`on_metadata_inventory_move`: Moving items in the inventory
* `on_take`/`on_metadata_inventory_take`: Taking items from the inventory
* `on_put`/`on_metadata_inventory_put`: Putting items to the inventory

#### Swapping

When a player tries to put an item to a place where another item is, the items are *swapped*.
This means that all callbacks will be called twice (once for each action).

`ItemStack`
-----------

An `ItemStack` is a stack of items.

It can be created via `ItemStack(x)`, where x is an `ItemStack`,
an itemstring, a table or `nil`.

### Methods

* `get_name()`: returns item name (e.g. `"default:stone"`).
* `set_name(item_name)`: returns a boolean indicating whether the item was
  cleared.

        * `short_description` in item metadata (See [Item Metadata].)
        * `short_description` in item definition
        * first line of the description (From item meta or def, see `get_description()`.)
        * Returns nil if none of the above are set
* `clear()`: removes all items from the stack, making it empty.
* `replace(item)`: replace the contents of this stack.
    * `item` can also be an itemstring or table.
* `to_string()`: returns the stack in itemstring form.
* `to_table()`: returns the stack in Lua table form.
* `get_stack_max()`: returns the maximum size of the stack (depends on the
  item).
* `get_free_space()`: returns `get_stack_max() - get_count()`.
* `is_known()`: returns `true` if the item name refers to a defined item type.

* `get_tool_capabilities()`: returns the digging properties of the item,
  or those of the hand if none are defined for this item type

  this one.
* `take_item(n)`: returns taken `ItemStack`
    * Take (and remove) up to `n` items from this stack
    * `n`: number, default: `1`
* `peek_item(n)`: returns taken `ItemStack`
    * Copy (don't remove) up to `n` items from this stack
    * `n`: number, default: `1`

`ItemStackMetaRef`
------------------

Can be obtained via `item:get_meta()`.

### Methods

* All methods in MetaDataRef
* `set_tool_capabilities([tool_capabilities])`
    * Overrides the item's tool capabilities
    * A nil value will clear the override data and restore the original
      behavior.

`MetaDataRef`
-------------

Base class used by [`StorageRef`], [`NodeMetaRef`], [`ItemStackMetaRef`],
and [`PlayerMetaRef`].

### Methods

* `contains(key)`: Returns true if key present, otherwise false.
    * Returns `nil` when the MetaData is inexistent.
* `get(key)`: Returns `nil` if key not present, else the stored string.
* `set_string(key, value)`: Value of `""` will delete the key.
* `get_string(key)`: Returns `""` if key not present.

* `from_table(nil or {})`
    * Any non-table value will clear the metadata
    * See [Node Metadata] for an example
    * returns `true` on success
* `equals(other)`
    * returns `true` if this metadata has the same key-value pairs as `other`

`ModChannel`
------------

An interface to use mod channels on client and server

### Methods

* `leave()`: leave the mod channel.
    * Server leaves channel `channel_name`.
    * No more incoming or outgoing messages can be sent to this channel from
      server mods.
    * This invalidate all future object usage.
    * Ensure you set mod_channel to nil after that to free Lua resources.
* `is_writeable()`: returns true if channel is writeable and mod can send over
  it.
* `send_all(message)`: Send `message` though the mod channel.
    * If mod channel is not writeable or invalid, message will be dropped.
    * Message size is limited to 65535 characters by protocol.

`NodeMetaRef`
-------------

Node metadata: reference extra data and functionality stored in a node.
Can be obtained via `minetest.get_meta(pos)`.

### Methods

* All methods in MetaDataRef
* `get_inventory()`: returns `InvRef`
* `mark_as_private(name or {name1, name2, ...})`: Mark specific vars as private
  This will prevent them from being sent to the client. Note that the "private"
  status will only be remembered if an associated key-value pair exists,
  meaning it's best to call this when initializing all other meta (e.g.
  `on_construct`).

`NodeTimerRef`
--------------

Node Timers: a high resolution persistent per-node timer.
Can be gotten via `minetest.get_node_timer(pos)`.

### Methods

* `set(timeout,elapsed)`
    * set a timer's state
    * `timeout` is in seconds, and supports fractional values (0.1 etc)
    * `elapsed` is in seconds, and supports fractional values (0.1 etc)
    * will trigger the node's `on_timer` function after `(timeout - elapsed)`
      seconds.
* `start(timeout)`
    * start a timer
    * equivalent to `set(timeout,0)`
* `stop()`
    * stops the timer
* `get_timeout()`: returns current timeout in seconds
    * if `timeout` equals `0`, timer is inactive
* `get_elapsed()`: returns current elapsed time in seconds
    * the node's `on_timer` function will be called after `(timeout - elapsed)`
      seconds.
* `is_started()`: returns boolean state of timer
    * returns `true` if timer is started, otherwise `false`

`ObjectRef`
-----------

Moving things in the game are generally these.
This is basically a reference to a C++ `ServerActiveObject`.

### Advice on handling `ObjectRefs`

When you receive an `ObjectRef` as a callback argument or from another API
function, it is possible to store the reference somewhere and keep it around.
It will keep functioning until the object is unloaded or removed.

However, doing this is **NOT** recommended as there is (intentionally) no method
to test if a previously acquired `ObjectRef` is still valid.
Instead, `ObjectRefs` should be "let go" of as soon as control is returned from
Lua back to the engine.
Doing so is much less error-prone and you will never need to wonder if the
object you are working with still exists.


### Methods

* `get_pos()`: returns `{x=num, y=num, z=num}`
* `set_pos(pos)`: `pos`=`{x=num, y=num, z=num}`
* `get_velocity()`: returns the velocity, a vector.
* `add_velocity(vel)`
    * `vel` is a vector, e.g. `{x=0.0, y=2.3, z=1.0}`
    * In comparison to using get_velocity, adding the velocity and then using
      set_velocity, add_velocity is supposed to avoid synchronization problems.
      Additionally, players also do not support set_velocity.
    * If a player:
        * Does not apply during free_move.
        * Note that since the player speed is normalized at each move step,
          increasing e.g. Y velocity beyond what would usually be achieved
          (see: physics overrides) will cause existing X/Z velocity to be reduced.
        * Example: `add_velocity({x=0, y=6.5, z=0})` is equivalent to
          pressing the jump key (assuming default settings)
* `move_to(pos, continuous=false)`
    * Does an interpolated move for Lua entities for visually smooth transitions.
    * If `continuous` is true, the Lua entity will not be moved to the current
      position before starting the interpolated move.
    * For players this does the same as `set_pos`,`continuous` is ignored.
* `punch(puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction)`

        bgcolor = ColorSpec or false,
        -- ^ Sets background color of nametag
        -- `false` will cause the background to be set automatically based on user settings
        -- Default: false
      }

#### Lua entity only (no-op for other objects)

`PcgRandom`
-----------

A 32-bit pseudorandom number generator.
Uses PCG32, an algorithm of the permuted congruential generator family,
offering very strong randomness.

It can be created via `PcgRandom(seed)` or `PcgRandom(seed, sequence)`.

### Methods

* `next()`: return next integer random number [`-2147483648`...`2147483647`]
* `next(min, max)`: return next integer random number [`min`...`max`]
* `rand_normal_dist(min, max, num_trials=6)`: return normally distributed
  random number [`min`...`max`].
    * This is only a rough approximation of a normal distribution with:
    * `mean = (max - min) / 2`, and
    * `variance = (((max - min + 1) ^ 2) - 1) / (12 * num_trials)`
    * Increasing `num_trials` improves accuracy of the approximation

`PerlinNoise`
-------------

A perlin noise generator.
It can be created via `PerlinNoise()` or `minetest.get_perlin()`.
For `minetest.get_perlin()`, the actual seed used is the noiseparams seed
plus the world seed, to create world-specific noise.

`PerlinNoise(noiseparams)`
`PerlinNoise(seed, octaves, persistence, spread)` (Deprecated).

`minetest.get_perlin(noiseparams)`
`minetest.get_perlin(seeddiff, octaves, persistence, spread)` (Deprecated).

### Methods

* `get_2d(pos)`: returns 2D noise value at `pos={x=,y=}`
* `get_3d(pos)`: returns 3D noise value at `pos={x=,y=,z=}`

`PerlinNoiseMap`
----------------

A fast, bulk perlin noise generator.

It can be created via `PerlinNoiseMap(noiseparams, size)` or
`minetest.get_perlin_map(noiseparams, size)`.
For `minetest.get_perlin_map()`, the actual seed used is the noiseparams seed
plus the world seed, to create world-specific noise.

Format of `size` is `{x=dimx, y=dimy, z=dimz}`. The `z` component is omitted
for 2D noise, and it must be must be larger than 1 for 3D noise (otherwise
`nil` is returned).

For each of the functions with an optional `buffer` parameter: If `buffer` is
not nil, this table will be used to store the result instead of creating a new
table.

### Methods

* `get_2d_map(pos)`: returns a `<size.x>` times `<size.y>` 2D array of 2D noise
  with values starting at `pos={x=,y=}`
* `get_3d_map(pos)`: returns a `<size.x>` times `<size.y>` times `<size.z>`
  3D array of 3D noise with values starting at `pos={x=,y=,z=}`.
* `get_2d_map_flat(pos, buffer)`: returns a flat `<size.x * size.y>` element
  array of 2D noise with values starting at `pos={x=,y=}`
* `get_3d_map_flat(pos, buffer)`: Same as `get2dMap_flat`, but 3D noise
* `calc_2d_map(pos)`: Calculates the 2d noise map starting at `pos`. The result
  is stored internally.
* `calc_3d_map(pos)`: Calculates the 3d noise map starting at `pos`. The result
  is stored internally.
* `get_map_slice(slice_offset, slice_size, buffer)`: In the form of an array,
  returns a slice of the most recently computed noise results. The result slice
  begins at coordinates `slice_offset` and takes a chunk of `slice_size`.
  E.g. to grab a 2-slice high horizontal 2d plane of noise starting at buffer
  offset y = 20:
  `noisevals = noise:get_map_slice({y=20}, {y=2})`
  It is important to note that `slice_offset` offset coordinates begin at 1,
  and are relative to the starting position of the most recently calculated
  noise.
  To grab a single vertical column of noise starting at map coordinates
  x = 1023, y=1000, z = 1000:
  `noise:calc_3d_map({x=1000, y=1000, z=1000})`
  `noisevals = noise:get_map_slice({x=24, z=1}, {x=1, z=1})`

`PlayerMetaRef`
---------------

Uses the same method of storage as the deprecated player attribute API, so
data there will also be in player meta.
Can be obtained using `player:get_meta()`.

### Methods

* All methods in MetaDataRef

`PseudoRandom`
--------------

A 16-bit pseudorandom number generator.
Uses a well-known LCG algorithm introduced by K&R.

It can be created via `PseudoRandom(seed)`.

### Methods

* `next()`: return next integer random number [`0`...`32767`]
* `next(min, max)`: return next integer random number [`min`...`max`]
    * `((max - min) == 32767) or ((max-min) <= 6553))` must be true
      due to the simple implementation making bad distribution otherwise.

`Raycast`
---------

A raycast on the map. It works with selection boxes.
Can be used as an iterator in a for loop as:

    local ray = Raycast(...)
    for pointed_thing in ray do
        ...
    end

The map is loaded as the ray advances. If the map is modified after the
`Raycast` is created, the changes may or may not have an effect on the object.

It can be created via `Raycast(pos1, pos2, objects, liquids)` or
`minetest.raycast(pos1, pos2, objects, liquids)` where:

* `pos1`: start of the ray
* `pos2`: end of the ray
* `objects`: if false, only nodes will be returned. Default is true.
* `liquids`: if false, liquid nodes won't be returned. Default is false.

### Methods

* `next()`: returns a `pointed_thing` with exact pointing location
    * Returns the next thing pointed by the ray or nil.

`SecureRandom`
--------------

Interface for the operating system's crypto-secure PRNG.

It can be created via `SecureRandom()`.  The constructor returns nil if a
secure random device cannot be found on the system.

### Methods

* `next_bytes([count])`: return next `count` (default 1, capped at 2048) many
  random bytes, as a string.

    * `default` is the value returned if `key` is not found.
    * Returns `nil` if `key` is not found and `default` not specified.
* `get_np_group(key)`: returns a NoiseParams table
* `get_flags(key)`:
    * Returns `{flag = true/false, ...}` according to the set flags.
    * Is currently limited to mapgen flags `mg_flags` and mapgen-specific
      flags like `mgv5_spflags`.
* `set(key, value)`
    * Setting names can't contain whitespace or any of `="{}#`.
    * Setting values can't contain the sequence `\n"""`.
    * Setting names starting with "secure." can't be set on the main settings
      object (`minetest.settings`).
* `set_bool(key, value)`
    * See documentation for set() above.
* `set_np_group(key, value)`
    * `value` is a NoiseParams table.
    * Also, see documentation for set() above.
* `remove(key)`: returns a boolean (`true` for success)
* `get_names()`: returns `{key1,...}`
* `write()`: returns a boolean (`true` for success)
    * Writes changes to file.

    foo = example text
    bar = """
    Multiline
    value
    """

LBM (LoadingBlockModifier) definition
-------------------------------------

Used by `minetest.register_lbm`.

A loading block modifier (LBM) is used to define a function that is called for
specific nodes (defined by `nodenames`) when a mapblock which contains such nodes
gets loaded.

    }

Tile definition
---------------

* `"image.png"`
* `{name="image.png", animation={Tile Animation definition}}`
* `{name="image.png", backface_culling=bool, align_style="node"/"world"/"user", scale=int}`
    * backface culling enabled by default for most nodes
    * align style determines whether the texture will be rotated with the node
      or kept aligned with its surroundings. "user" means that client
      setting will be used, similar to `glasslike_framed_optional`.
      Note: supported by solid nodes and nodeboxes only.
    * scale is used to make texture span several (exactly `scale`) nodes,
      instead of just one, in each direction. Works for world-aligned
      textures only.
      Note that as the effect is applied on per-mapblock basis, `16` should
      be equally divisible by `scale` or you may get wrong results.
* `{name="image.png", color=ColorSpec}`
    * the texture's color will be multiplied with this color.
    * the tile's color overrides the owning node's color in all cases.
* deprecated, yet still supported field names:
    * `image` (name)

Chat command definition
-----------------------

Used by `minetest.register_chatcommand`.

        description = "Remove privilege from player",  -- Full description

        privs = {privs=true},  -- Require the "privs" privilege to run

        func = function(name, param),

        -- Special case: The help message is shown to the player if `func`
        -- returns false without a text output.
    }

Note that in params, use of symbols is as follows:

* `<>` signifies a placeholder to be replaced when the command is used. For
  example, when a player name is needed: `<name>`
* `[]` signifies param is optional and not required when the command is used.
  For example, if you require param1 but param2 is optional:
  `<param1> [<param2>]`
* `|` signifies exclusive or. The command requires one param from the options
  provided. For example: `<param1> | <param2>`
* `()` signifies grouping. For example, when param1 and param2 are both
  required, or only param3 is required: `(<param1> <param2>) | <param3>`
