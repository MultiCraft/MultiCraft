Paths
-----
Locations:

* `bin`   - Compiled binaries
* `share` - Distributed read-only data
* `user`  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

* Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
    * `bin`   = `bin`
    * `share` = `.`
    * `user`  = `.`
* Windows installed:
    * `bin`   = `C:\Program Files\MultiCraft\bin (Depends on the install location)`
    * `share` = `C:\Program Files\MultiCraft (Depends on the install location)`
    * `user`  = `%APPDATA%\MultiCraft`
* Linux installed:
    * `bin`   = `/usr/bin`
    * `share` = `/usr/share/multicraft`
    * `user`  = `~/.multicraft`
* macOS:
    * `bin`   = `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share` = `Contents/Resources`
    * `user`  = `Contents/User OR ~/Library/Application Support/multicraft`

Worlds can be found as separate folders in: `user/worlds/`

Configuration file
------------------
- Default location:
    `user/multicraft.conf`
- This file is created by closing MultiCraft for the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `location_of_exe/../multicraft.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../multicraft.conf`

Command-line options
--------------------
- Use `--help`

#### Download

You can install Git for easily keeping your copy up to date.
If you don’t want Git, read below on how to get the source without Git.
This is an example for installing Git on Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install git

For Fedora users:

    sudo dnf install git

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using Git:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MultiCraft/MultiCraft.git
    cd MultiCraft

Download source, without using Git:

    wget https://github.com/MultiCraft/MultiCraft/archive/main.tar.gz
    tar xf main.tar.gz
    cd MultiCraft-main

#### Build

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:

    cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=TRUE
    make -j$(nproc)

Run it:

    ./bin/multicraft

- Use `cmake . -LH` to see all CMake options and their current state.
- If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package),
  you will want to use `-DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE`.
- You can build a bare server by specifying `-DBUILD_SERVER=TRUE`.
- You can disable the client build by specifying `-DBUILD_CLIENT=FALSE`.
- You can select between Release and Debug build by `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>`.
  - Debug build is slower, but gives much more useful output in a debugger.
- If you build a bare server you don't need to have Irrlicht installed.
  - In that case use `-DIRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR=/the/irrlicht/source`.

### Compiling on Windows

### Requirements

- [Visual Studio 2015 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Compiling and installing the dependencies

It is highly recommended to use vcpkg as package manager.

#### a) Using vcpkg to install dependencies

After you successfully built vcpkg you can easily install the required libraries:
```powershell
vcpkg install irrlicht zlib curl[winssl] openal-soft libvorbis libogg sqlite3 freetype luajit gmp jsoncpp --triplet x64-windows
```

- `curl` is optional, but required to read the serverlist, `curl[winssl]` is required to use the content store.
- `openal-soft`, `libvorbis` and `libogg` are optional, but required to use sound.
- `freetype` is optional, it allows true-type font rendering.
- `luajit` is optional, it replaces the integrated Lua interpreter with a faster just-in-time interpreter.
- `gmp` and `jsoncpp` are optional, otherwise the bundled versions will be compiled

There are other optional libraries, but they are not tested if they can build and link correctly.

Use `--triplet` to specify the target triplet, e.g. `x64-windows` or `x86-windows`.

#### b) Compile the dependencies on your own

### Compile MultiCraft

#### a) Using the vcpkg toolchain and CMake GUI
1. Start up the CMake GUI
2. Select **Browse Source...** and select DIR/multicraft
3. Select **Browse Build...** and select DIR/multicraft-build
4. Select **Configure**
5. Choose the right visual Studio version and target platform. It has to match the version of the installed dependencies
6. Choose **Specify toolchain file for cross-compiling**
7. Click **Next**
8. Select the vcpkg toolchain file e.g. `D:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
9. Click Finish
10. Wait until cmake have generated the cash file
11. If there are any errors, solve them and hit **Configure**
12. Click **Generate**
13. Click **Open Project**
14. Compile MultiCraft inside Visual studio.

#### b) Using the vcpkg toolchain and the commandline

Run the following script in PowerShell:

```powershell
cmake . -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_GETTEXT=OFF -DENABLE_CURSES=OFF -DENABLE_SYSTEM_JSONCPP=ON
cmake --build . --config Release
```
Make sure that the right compiler is selected and the path to the vcpkg toolchain is correct.

#### c) Using your own compiled libraries

**This is outdated and not recommended**

### Windows Installer using WiX Toolset

Requirements:
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/)

In the Visual Studio 2017 Installer select **Optional Features -> WiX Toolset**.

Build the binaries as described above, but make sure you unselect `RUN_IN_PLACE`.

Open the generated project file with Visual Studio. Right-click **Package** and choose **Generate**.
It may take some minutes to generate the installer.
